## 背景             
QQ群里聊到关于PostgreSQL范围锁的话题. 大概是这样的 :   
  
```  
BEGIN;  
update t set c1=? where c2>? ;  
```  
  
在COMMIT或者ROLLBACK之前, 这种SQL可能会锁上很多行?  
  
1\. 在这种情况下会不会升级成表锁?  
  
2\. 如果要锁的行数非常多会不会造成内存资源的开销非常大?  
  
3\. 如果这条SQL要更新100000行, 那么是不是需要100000个锁对象?   
  
首先, 锁的管理非常复杂, 三言两语也讲不清楚,  这里只涉及非常小的一部分（Regular Lock(a/k/a heavyweight locks)）, 未涉及到spin lock和lwlock. 所以需要深入研究的朋友情参考本文末尾的参考部分.  
  
至于前面提到的两个问题,   
  
1\. 在这种情况下会不会升级成表锁?  这个肯定是不会的.   
  
2\. 如果要锁的行数非常多会不会造成内存资源的开销非常大?    
  
```  
A LOCK object exists for each lockable object that currently has locks held or requested on it.    
A PROCLOCK struct exists for each backend that is holding or requesting lock(s) on each LOCK object.  
```  
  
从这句话来看,  锁对象越多必然会增加内存的开销, 但是事实上并不是这样的, 因为lock hash table的size是有限的(等于max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)). 后面会讲到, 真是柳暗花明又一村的感觉. (第三个问题也在后面会有解释. 在lock hash table中理论上不会有100000个锁对象存在(见heap_lock_tuple).)  
  
但是有必要把大量的tuple lock自动升级成table lock锁吗? 我认为没必要, 这种场景应该人为来控制, 而不是让数据库来自动升锁级别, 包括Oracle也不会这么干. 但是MySQL锁的处理就比较差了, 可参看这里的测试:   
  
http://blog.163.com/digoal@126/blog/static/163877040201042683410679/  
  
LOCK对象的数据结构如下 :   
  
```  
typedef struct LOCK  
{  
        /* hash key */  
        LOCKTAG         tag;                    /* unique identifier of lockable object */  
  
        /* data */  
        LOCKMASK        grantMask;              /* bitmask for lock types already granted */  
        LOCKMASK        waitMask;               /* bitmask for lock types awaited */  
        SHM_QUEUE       procLocks;              /* list of PROCLOCK objects assoc. with lock */  
        PROC_QUEUE      waitProcs;              /* list of PGPROC objects waiting on lock */  
        int                     requested[MAX_LOCKMODES];               /* counts of requested locks */  
        int                     nRequested;             /* total of requested[] array */  
        int                     granted[MAX_LOCKMODES]; /* counts of granted locks */  
        int                     nGranted;               /* total of granted[] array */  
} LOCK;  
```  
  
从tag也就是LOCKTAG的数据结构能够看出tuple也在类型之中, 这也印证了PostgreSQL的锁粒度确实是到达了行级别的.  
  
```  
typedef struct LOCKTAG  
{  
        uint32          locktag_field1; /* a 32-bit ID field */  
        uint32          locktag_field2; /* a 32-bit ID field */  
        uint32          locktag_field3; /* a 32-bit ID field */  
        uint16          locktag_field4; /* a 16-bit ID field */  
        uint8           locktag_type;   /* see enum LockTagType */  
        uint8           locktag_lockmethodid;   /* lockmethod indicator */  
} LOCKTAG;  
```  
  
枚举LockTagType定义如下 :   
  
```  
/*  
 * LOCKTAG is the key information needed to look up a LOCK item in the  
 * lock hashtable.      A LOCKTAG value uniquely identifies a lockable object.  
 *  
 * The LockTagType enum defines the different kinds of objects we can lock.  
 * We can handle up to 256 different LockTagTypes.  
 */  
typedef enum LockTagType  
{  
        LOCKTAG_RELATION,                       /* whole relation */  
        /* ID info for a relation is DB OID + REL OID; DB OID = 0 if shared */  
        LOCKTAG_RELATION_EXTEND,        /* the right to extend a relation */  
        /* same ID info as RELATION */  
        LOCKTAG_PAGE,                           /* one page of a relation */  
        /* ID info for a page is RELATION info + BlockNumber */  
        LOCKTAG_TUPLE,                          /* one physical tuple */  
        /* ID info for a tuple is PAGE info + OffsetNumber */  
        LOCKTAG_TRANSACTION,            /* transaction (for waiting for xact done) */  
        /* ID info for a transaction is its TransactionId */  
        LOCKTAG_VIRTUALTRANSACTION, /* virtual transaction (ditto) */  
        /* ID info for a virtual transaction is its VirtualTransactionId */  
        LOCKTAG_OBJECT,                         /* non-relation database object */  
        /* ID info for an object is DB OID + CLASS OID + OBJECT OID + SUBID */  
  
        /*  
         * Note: object ID has same representation as in pg_depend and  
         * pg_description, but notice that we are constraining SUBID to 16 bits.  
         * Also, we use DB OID = 0 for shared objects such as tablespaces.  
         */  
        LOCKTAG_USERLOCK,                       /* reserved for old contrib/userlock code */  
        LOCKTAG_ADVISORY                        /* advisory user locks */  
} LockTagType;  
```  
  
以下这个macro则是用来设置tuple锁对象的值的.  
  
```  
#define SET_LOCKTAG_TUPLE(locktag,dboid,reloid,blocknum,offnum) \  
        ((locktag).locktag_field1 = (dboid), \  
         (locktag).locktag_field2 = (reloid), \  
         (locktag).locktag_field3 = (blocknum), \  
         (locktag).locktag_field4 = (offnum), \  
         (locktag).locktag_type = LOCKTAG_TUPLE, \  
         (locktag).locktag_lockmethodid = DEFAULT_LOCKMETHOD)  
```  
  
LOCK的锁信息存储在共享内存中的hash表中, 键值为LOCKTAG 进行检索.  
  
为了减少冲突, hash表做了分区处理 :   
  
```  
* The shared-memory hash tables for LOCKs and PROCLOCKs are organized so that different partitions use different hash chains,   
and thus there is no conflict in working with objects in different partitions.    
This is supported directly by dynahash.c's "partitioned table" mechanism for the LOCK table:   
we need only ensure that the partition number is taken from the low-order bits of the dynahash hash value for the LOCKTAG.  
To make it work for PROCLOCKs, we have to ensure that a PROCLOCK's hash value has the same low-order bits as its associated LOCK.    
This requires a specialized hash function (see proclock_hash).  
  
除了共享的lock hash table之外, 每个bacnekd 还维护非共享的本地hash table. 包含了已经获得的锁信息以及请求中的锁信息.  
  
Each backend also maintains an unshared LOCALLOCK structure for each lockable  
object and lock mode that it is currently holding or requesting.  The shared  
lock structures only allow a single lock grant to be made per lockable  
object/lock mode/backend.  Internally to a backend, however, the same lock may  
be requested and perhaps released multiple times in a transaction, and it can  
also be held both transactionally and session-wide.  The internal request  
counts are held in LOCALLOCK so that the shared data structures need not be  
accessed to alter them.  
```  
  
数据结构如下 :   
  
```  
/*  
 * Each backend also maintains a local hash table with information about each  
 * lock it is currently interested in.  In particular the local table counts  
 * the number of times that lock has been acquired.  This allows multiple  
 * requests for the same lock to be executed without additional accesses to  
 * shared memory.  We also track the number of lock acquisitions per  
 * ResourceOwner, so that we can release just those locks belonging to a  
 * particular ResourceOwner.  
 */  
typedef struct LOCALLOCKTAG  
{  
        LOCKTAG         lock;                   /* identifies the lockable object */  
        LOCKMODE        mode;                   /* lock mode for this table entry */  
} LOCALLOCKTAG;  
  
typedef struct LOCALLOCKOWNER  
{  
        /*  
         * Note: if owner is NULL then the lock is held on behalf of the session;  
         * otherwise it is held on behalf of my current transaction.  
         *  
         * Must use a forward struct reference to avoid circularity.  
         */  
        struct ResourceOwnerData *owner;  
        int64           nLocks;                 /* # of times held by this owner */  
} LOCALLOCKOWNER;  
  
typedef struct LOCALLOCK  
{  
        /* tag */  
        LOCALLOCKTAG tag;                       /* unique identifier of locallock entry */  
  
        /* data */  
        LOCK       *lock;                       /* associated LOCK object in shared mem */  
        PROCLOCK   *proclock;           /* associated PROCLOCK object in shmem */  
        uint32          hashcode;               /* copy of LOCKTAG's hash value */  
        int64           nLocks;                 /* total number of times lock is held */  
        int                     numLockOwners;  /* # of relevant ResourceOwners */  
        int                     maxLockOwners;  /* allocated size of array */  
        bool            holdsStrongLockCount;   /* bumped FastPathStrongRelatonLocks? */  
        LOCALLOCKOWNER *lockOwners; /* dynamically resizable array */  
} LOCALLOCK;  
  
#define LOCALLOCK_LOCKMETHOD(llock) ((llock).tag.lock.locktag_lockmethodid)  
```  
  
因为不涉及冲突, 所以本地hash table不需要做分区处理. 另外就是数据结构相比LOCK和LOCKTAG简化了许多. 但是同样会消耗内存.  
  
接下来看看PostgreSQL在哪里调用了 SET_LOCKTAG_TUPLE 来请求tuple lock.  
  
```  
/*  
 *              LockTuple  
 *  
 * Obtain a tuple-level lock.  This is used in a less-than-intuitive fashion  
 * because we can't afford to keep a separate lock in shared memory for every  
 * tuple.  See heap_lock_tuple before using this!  
 */  
void  
LockTuple(Relation relation, ItemPointer tid, LOCKMODE lockmode)  
{  
        LOCKTAG         tag;  
  
        SET_LOCKTAG_TUPLE(tag,  
                                          relation->rd_lockInfo.lockRelId.dbId,  
                                          relation->rd_lockInfo.lockRelId.relId,  
                                          ItemPointerGetBlockNumber(tid),  
                                          ItemPointerGetOffsetNumber(tid));  
  
        (void) LockAcquire(&tag, lockmode, false, false);  
}  
```  
  
注意到, we can't afford to keep a separate lock in shared memory for every tuple. 为什么呢?  
  
```  
 * NOTES: because the shared-memory lock table is of finite size, but users  
 * could reasonably want to lock large numbers of tuples, we do not rely on  
 * the standard lock manager to store tuple-level locks over the long term.  
```

/*  
 *      heap_lock_tuple - lock a tuple in shared or exclusive mode  
 *  
 * Note that this acquires a buffer pin, which the caller must release.  
 *  
 * Input parameters:  
 *      relation: relation containing tuple (caller must hold suitable lock)  
 *      tuple->t_self: TID of tuple to lock (rest of struct need not be valid)  
 *      cid: current command ID (used for visibility test, and stored into  
 *              tuple's cmax if lock is successful)  
 *      mode: indicates if shared or exclusive tuple lock is desired  
 *      nowait: if true, ereport rather than blocking if lock not available  
 *  
 * Output parameters:  
 *      *tuple: all fields filled in  
 *      *buffer: set to buffer holding tuple (pinned but not locked at exit)  
 *      *ctid: set to tuple's t_ctid, but only in failure cases  
 *      *update_xmax: set to tuple's xmax, but only in failure cases  
 *  
 * Function result may be:  
 *      HeapTupleMayBeUpdated: lock was successfully acquired  
 *      HeapTupleSelfUpdated: lock failed because tuple updated by self  
 *      HeapTupleUpdated: lock failed because tuple updated by other xact  
 *  
 * In the failure cases, the routine returns the tuple's t_ctid and t_xmax.  
 * If t_ctid is the same as t_self, the tuple was deleted; if different, the  
 * tuple was updated, and t_ctid is the location of the replacement tuple.  
 * (t_xmax is needed to verify that the replacement tuple matches.)  
 *  
 *  
 * NOTES: because the shared-memory lock table is of finite size, but users  
 * could reasonably want to lock large numbers of tuples, we do not rely on  
 * the standard lock manager to store tuple-level locks over the long term.  
 * Instead, a tuple is marked as locked by setting the current transaction's  
 * XID as its XMAX, and setting additional infomask bits to distinguish this  
 * usage from the more normal case of having deleted the tuple.  When  
 * multiple transactions concurrently share-lock a tuple, the first locker's  
 * XID is replaced in XMAX with a MultiTransactionId representing the set of  
 * XIDs currently holding share-locks.  
 *  
 * When it is necessary to wait for a tuple-level lock to be released, the  
 * basic delay is provided by XactLockTableWait or MultiXactIdWait on the  
 * contents of the tuple's XMAX.  However, that mechanism will release all  
 * waiters concurrently, so there would be a race condition as to which  
 * waiter gets the tuple, potentially leading to indefinite starvation of  
 * some waiters.  The possibility of share-locking makes the problem much  
 * worse --- a steady stream of share-lockers can easily block an exclusive  
 * locker forever.      To provide more reliable semantics about who gets a  
 * tuple-level lock first, we use the standard lock manager.  The protocol  
 * for waiting for a tuple-level lock is really  
 *              LockTuple()  
 *              XactLockTableWait()  
 *              mark tuple as locked by me  
 *              UnlockTuple()  
 * When there are multiple waiters, arbitration of who is to get the lock next  
 * is provided by LockTuple().  However, at most one tuple-level lock will  
 * be held or awaited per backend at any time, so we don't risk overflow  
 * of the lock table.  Note that incoming share-lockers are required to  
 * do LockTuple as well, if there is any conflict, to ensure that they don't  
 * starve out waiting exclusive-lockers.  However, if there is not any active  
 * conflict for a tuple, we don't incur any extra overhead.

```  
  
在分析PostgreSQL怎么处理行锁前. 首先我们要分析的是tuple head 结构, 取自src/include/access/htup.h, 如下 :   
  
```  
typedef struct HeapTupleHeaderData  
{  
        union  
        {  
                HeapTupleFields t_heap;  
                DatumTupleFields t_datum;  
        }                       t_choice;  
  
        ItemPointerData t_ctid;         /* current TID of this or newer tuple */  
  
        /* Fields below here must match MinimalTupleData! */  
  
        uint16          t_infomask2;    /* number of attributes + various flags */  
  
        uint16          t_infomask;             /* various flag bits, see below */  
  
        uint8           t_hoff;                 /* sizeof header incl. bitmap, padding */  
  
        /* ^ - 23 bytes - ^ */  
  
        bits8           t_bits[1];              /* bitmap of NULLs -- VARIABLE LENGTH */  
  
        /* MORE DATA FOLLOWS AT END OF STRUCT */  
} HeapTupleHeaderData;  
```  
  
其中HeapTupleFields的数据结构如下(这里包含了cid和xmin,xmax的信息, MVCC与之息息相关) :   
  
```  
typedef struct HeapTupleFields  
{  
        TransactionId t_xmin;           /* inserting xact ID */  
        TransactionId t_xmax;           /* deleting or locking xact ID */  
  
        union  
        {  
                CommandId       t_cid;          /* inserting or deleting command ID, or both */  
                TransactionId t_xvac;   /* old-style VACUUM FULL xact ID */  
        }                       t_field3;  
} HeapTupleFields;  
```  
  
其中t_infomask的允许值组合如下, 锁信息将存储在这里面 :   
  
```  
/*

```  
  
因为行锁的信息在PostgreSQL的pg_locks里面无法检索到, 所以接下来我们看看PostgreSQL提供的pgrowlocks模块是怎么检索行锁信息的?  
  
取自contrib/pgrowlocks/pgrowlocks.c :   
  
截取pgrowlocks(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)一段如下 :   
  
```  
/* scan the relation */  
        while ((tuple = heap_getnext(scan, ForwardScanDirection)) != NULL)  
        {  
                /* must hold a buffer lock to call HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate */  
                LockBuffer(scan->rs_cbuf, BUFFER_LOCK_SHARE);  
  
                if (HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate(tuple->t_data,  
                                                                         GetCurrentCommandId(false),  
                                                                         scan->rs_cbuf) == HeapTupleBeingUpdated)  
                {  
  
                        char      **values;  
                        int                     i;  
  
                        values = (char **) palloc(mydata->ncolumns * sizeof(char *));  
  
                        i = 0;  
                        values[i++] = (char *) DirectFunctionCall1(tidout, PointerGetDatum(&tuple->t_self));  
  
                        if (tuple->t_data->t_infomask & HEAP_XMAX_SHARED_LOCK)  
                                values[i++] = pstrdup("Shared");  
                        else  
                                values[i++] = pstrdup("Exclusive");  
                        values[i] = palloc(NCHARS * sizeof(char));  
                        snprintf(values[i++], NCHARS, "%d", HeapTupleHeaderGetXmax(tuple->t_data));  
```  
  
显然pgrowlocks需要遍历全表, 通过HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate判断正在被更新/删除的行以及这个tuple head的t_infomask信息是否带有HEAP_XMAX_SHARED_LOCK来判断是Shared LOCK还是Exclusive LOCK.   
  
所以在update和select ... for update时, 必定会涉及到tuple head的t_infomask部分信息的更新以及xmin, xmax的更新.   
  
1\. 对于update, 无疑是修改了"原tuple head"并且也新增了tuple以及tuple head (这又涉及到MVCC了).  
  
2\. 而对于select ... for update呢, 则只涉及到"原tuple head"的t_infomask信息的修改.  
  
以上两点我们可以通过pgrowlocks以及pageinspect来观察.  
  
为了更好的理解本文的意思, 建议读者可以去了解一下PostgreSQL的MVCC机制, 本文就不多介绍了. 我之前写过一些BLOG专门介绍MVCC, 有兴趣的朋友可以参考《PostgreSQL XLOG fsync simple introduce》的"三、which tuples can be saw by client? must satisfied two factors below at the same time." 部分的介绍.   
  
接下来我们可以通过pgrowlocks和pageinspect来观察, 观察t_infomask时需要对照头文件中定义的常量解析出对应的常量名.  
  
测试三种场景, 我这里用到的是PostgreSQL 9.2.0版本进行的测试 :   
  
1\. select ... for share  
  
2\. select ... for update  
  
3\. update ...  
  
首先创建测试表 :   
  
```  
digoal=> create table pg_lock_test (id int, info text);  
CREATE TABLE  
```  
  
插入1000W条测试记录  
  
```  
digoal=> insert into pg_lock_test select generate_series(1,10000000),'digoal';  
INSERT 0 10000000  
```  
  
创建pgrowlocks以及pageinspect  extension, 我这里以及创建了, 就不重复叙述了.  
  
```  
digoal=> \c digoal postgres  
You are now connected to database "digoal" as user "postgres".  
digoal=# \dx  
                                List of installed extensions  
    Name     | Version |   Schema   |                      Description                        
-------------+---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------  
 pageinspect | 1.0     | public     | inspect the contents of database pages at a low level  
 pgrowlocks  | 1.0     | public     | show row-level locking information  
 plpgsql     | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language  
 uuid-ossp   | 1.0     | public     | generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs)  
(4 rows)  
```  
  
先定位一条需要测试到的记录, 记住这里的ctid,xmin,xmax :   
  
注意这里用到了全表扫描耗时是1376毫秒, 后面我们能注意到pgrowlocks差不多也需要耗时1376毫秒, 因为它也是需要遍历全表的.  
  
```  
digoal=> select ctid,cmin,cmax,xmin,xmax,* from pg_lock_test where id=1;  
 ctid  | cmin | cmax |   xmin    | xmax | id |  info    
-------+------+------+-----------+------+----+--------  
 (0,1) |    0 |    0 | 171985481 |    0 |  1 | digoal  
(1 row)  
Time: 1376.308 ms  
```  
  
## 一、 接下来测试select ... for share  
SESSION A :   
  
```  
digoal=> begin;  
BEGIN  
Time: 0.181 ms  
digoal=> select ctid,cmin,cmax,xmin,xmax,* from pg_lock_test where id=1 for share;  
 ctid  | cmin | cmax |   xmin    | xmax | id |  info    
-------+------+------+-----------+------+----+--------  
 (0,1) |    0 |    0 | 171985481 |    0 |  1 | digoal  
(1 row)  
Time: 1402.846 ms  
digoal=> select * from pg_backend_pid();  
 pg_backend_pid   
----------------  
           1934  
(1 row)  
Time: 0.406 ms  
```  
  
SESSION B :   
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type |  locker   | multi |    xids     |  pids    
------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------------+--------  
 (0,1)      | Shared    | 171985482 | f     | {171985482} | {1934}  
(1 row)  
Time: 1171.961 ms  
```  
  
我们看到,   
1\. pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test') 的耗时为1171毫秒. 和遍历全表的时间差不多, 比SELECT时间略小是因为SELECT语句还加了判断需要耗费更多的资源, 并且pgrowlocks只需要看tuple head.  
  
2\. digoal.pg_lock_test的行锁有1条, 锁这行的事务的事务号为171985482. pid=1934.  
  
3\. 锁类型为 Shared. 对pgrowlocks应代码里面的 "tuple->t_data->t_infomask & HEAP_XMAX_SHARED_LOCK" . 一会我们从pageinspect的结果中就能看到.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=1;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 | t_ctid | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+--------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  1 |   8152 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985482 |        0 | (0,1)  |           2 |        386 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.751 ms  
```  
  
这里 lp=1 对应的是ctid(0,1)里面的1. 而get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0) 对应的是ctid(0,1)里的0号page.  
  
t_infomask=386 转成16进制就是0x0182 包含了如下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_XMAX_SHARED_LOCK  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
```  
  
接下来分析一下select ... for share会不会产生新的tuple版本.  
  
从下面的t_xmin中没有171985482可以看出select ... for share 没有产生新的tuple版本.  
  
```  
digoal=# select max(ctid) from digoal.pg_lock_test;  
    max       
------------  
 (54054,10)  
(1 row)  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',54054));  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   | t_xmax | t_field3 |   t_ctid   | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  1 |   8152 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,1)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  2 |   8112 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,2)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  3 |   8072 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,3)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  4 |   8032 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,4)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  5 |   7992 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,5)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  6 |   7952 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,6)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  7 |   7912 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,7)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  8 |   7872 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,8)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
  9 |   7832 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,9)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
 10 |   7792 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,10) |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
(10 rows)  
```  
  
回滚SESSION A后, pgrowlocks就看不到digoal.pg_lock_test的锁信息了.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type | locker | multi | xids | pids   
------------+-----------+--------+-------+------+------  
(0 rows)  
Time: 1178.131 ms  
```  
  
再观察ctid(0,1)的tuple head信息.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=1;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 | t_ctid | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+--------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  1 |   8152 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985482 |        0 | (0,1)  |           2 |        2434 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.689 ms  
```  
  
t_xmax 变成了171985482, t_infomask变更为2434 转成16进制就是982 是以下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
HEAP_XMAX_INVALID  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
HEAP_XMAX_SHARED_LOCK  
```  
  
说明这条记录的xmax是无效的(这里的t_xman记录了锁/回滚这条记录的事务ID, 回滚后t_xmax标记为无效, 所以锁也随之失效).  
  
## 二、 接下来测试select ... for update, 这次我们取ID=2的记录.  
  
SESSION A :   
  
```  
digoal=> begin;  
BEGIN  
Time: 0.174 ms  
digoal=> select ctid,cmin,cmax,xmin,xmax,* from pg_lock_test where id=2 for update;  
 ctid  | cmin | cmax |   xmin    |   xmax    | id |  info    
-------+------+------+-----------+-----------+----+--------  
 (0,2) |    0 |    0 | 171985481 | 171985483 |  2 | digoal  
(1 row)  
Time: 1231.744 ms  
digoal=> select * from pg_backend_pid();  
 pg_backend_pid   
----------------  
           1934  
(1 row)  
Time: 0.373 ms  
```  
  
SESSION B :   
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type |  locker   | multi |    xids     |  pids    
------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------------+--------  
 (0,2)      | Exclusive | 171985490 | f     | {171985490} | {1934}  
(1 row)  
Time: 1185.471 ms  
```  
  
我们看到,   
1\. digoal.pg_lock_test的行锁有1条, 锁这行的事务的事务号为171985490. pid=1934.  
  
2\. 锁类型为 Exclusive.  
  
查看ctid=(0,2)的tuple head信息  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=2;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 | t_ctid | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+--------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  2 |   8112 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985490 |        0 | (0,2)  |           2 |        322 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.697 ms  
```  
  
t_infomask=322 转成16进制就是0x0142 包含了如下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_XMAX_EXCL_LOCK  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
```  
  
接下来分析一下select ... for update会不会产生新的tuple版本. 因为根据MVCC机制新的tuple SESSION B是看不到的, 所以我这里要检索整个块.  
  
从下面的t_xmin中没有171985490可以看出select ... for update 没有产生新的tuple版本.  
  
```

  9 |   7832 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 |      0 |        0 | (54054,9)  |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |

digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',54055));  
ERROR:  block number 54055 is out of range for relation "pg_lock_test"  
Time: 0.463 ms  
```  
  
块超出,说明54054已经是最大块了, 没有遗漏. 说明select ... for update绝对不可能产生了新的tuple.  
  
回滚SESSION A后, pgrowlocks就看不到digoal.pg_lock_test的锁信息了.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type | locker | multi | xids | pids   
------------+-----------+--------+-------+------+------  
(0 rows)  
Time: 1178.131 ms  
```  
  
再观察ctid(0,2)的tuple head信息.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=2;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 | t_ctid | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+--------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  2 |   8112 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985490 |        0 | (0,2)  |           2 |       2370 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.689 ms  
```  
  
t_xmax 变成了171985490, t_infomask变更为2370 转成16进制就是942 是以下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
HEAP_XMAX_INVALID  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
HEAP_XMAX_EXCL_LOCK  
```  
  
说明这条记录的xmax是无效的(这里的t_xman记录了锁/回滚这条记录的事务ID, 回滚后t_xmax标记为无效, 所以锁也随之失效).  
  
## 三、 最后要测试update. 这是会产生新的tuple的操作. 这次我们取ID=3的记录.  
SESSION A :   
  
```  
digoal=> begin;  
BEGIN  
Time: 0.178 ms  
digoal=> select ctid,cmin,cmax,xmin,xmax,* from pg_lock_test where id=3;  
 ctid  | cmin | cmax |   xmin    |   xmax    | id |  info    
-------+------+------+-----------+-----------+----+--------  
 (0,3) |    0 |    0 | 171985481 | 171985483 |  3 | digoal  
(1 row)  
Time: 1242.763 ms  
digoal=> select * from pg_backend_pid();  
 pg_backend_pid   
----------------  
           1934  
(1 row)  
Time: 0.294 ms  
digoal=> update pg_lock_test set info='test' where id=3;  
UPDATE 1  
Time: 1227.698 ms  
  
-- 这里会话A看到的是自己修改过的但是尚未提交的id=3的记录, 所以xmin=171985491. ctid是在BLOCKs的最末端插入的=(54054,11) .  
  
digoal=> select ctid,cmin,cmax,xmin,xmax,* from pg_lock_test where id=3;  
    ctid    | cmin | cmax |   xmin    | xmax | id | info   
------------+------+------+-----------+------+----+------  
 (54054,11) |    0 |    0 | 171985491 |    0 |  3 | test  
(1 row)  
Time: 1235.105 ms  
```  
  
  
SESSION B :   
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type |  locker   | multi |    xids     |  pids    
------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------------+--------  
 (0,3)      | Exclusive | 171985491 | f     | {171985491} | {1934}  
(1 row)  
Time: 1182.028 ms  
```  
  
我们看到,   
  
1\. digoal.pg_lock_test的行锁有1条, 锁这行的事务的事务号为171985491. pid=1934.  
  
2\. 锁类型为 Exclusive.  
  
  
查看这里被锁的行ctid=(0,3)的tuple head信息  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=3;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 |   t_ctid   | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  3 |   8072 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985491 |        0 | (54054,11) |           2 |        258 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.716 ms  
```  
  
t_infomask=258 转成16进制就是0x0102 包含了如下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
```  
  
注意这里的t_ctid=54054,11 说明这条记录还指向了另一条tuple. 那就是update后新插入的tuple, tuple头信息如下 :   
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',54054)) where lp=11;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   | t_xmax | t_field3 |   t_ctid   | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+--------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
 11 |   7752 |        1 |     33 | 171985491 |      0 |        0 | (54054,11) |           2 |      10242 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.599 ms  
```  
  
t_infomask=10242 转成16进制就是0x2802 包含了如下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_UPDATED  
HEAP_XMAX_INVALID  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
```  
  
说明还未提交.   
  
回滚SESSION A后, pgrowlocks就看不到digoal.pg_lock_test的锁信息了.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pgrowlocks('digoal.pg_lock_test');  
 locked_row | lock_type | locker | multi | xids | pids   
------------+-----------+--------+-------+------+------  
(0 rows)  
Time: 1178.131 ms  
```  
  
再观察ctid(0,3)的tuple head信息.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',0)) where lp=3;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   |  t_xmax   | t_field3 |   t_ctid   | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid   
----+--------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+--------+--------+-------  
  3 |   8072 |        1 |     35 | 171985481 | 171985491 |        0 | (54054,11) |           2 |       2306 |     24 |        |        
(1 row)  
Time: 0.711 ms  
```  
  
t_xmax 变成了171985491, t_infomask变更为2306 转成16进制就是902 是以下组合 :   
  
```  
HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED  
HEAP_XMAX_INVALID  
HEAP_HASVARWIDTH  
```  
  
再观察ctid(54054,11)的tuple head信息.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from heap_page_items(get_raw_page('digoal.pg_lock_test',54054)) where lp=11;  
 lp | lp_off | lp_flags | lp_len |  t_xmin   | t_xmax | t_field3 |   t_ctid   | t_infomask2 | t_infomask | t_hoff | t_bits | t_oid

(1 row)  
Time: 0.624 ms  
```  
  
t_xmax 变成了171985491, t_infomask变更为10754 转成16进制就是2A02 是以下组合 :   
  
```

10\. src/tools/backend/index.html  
  
11\. http://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/locking.pdf 讲得比较浅, 那几个视图还是比较有用的.  
  
12\. shared hash lock table :   
  
```  
max_locks_per_transaction (integer)  
  
The shared lock table tracks locks on max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions) objects (e.g., tables);   
hence, no more than this many distinct objects can be locked at any one time. This parameter controls the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction;   
individual transactions can lock more objects as long as the locks of all transactions fit in the lock table. This is not the number of rows that can be locked; that value is unlimited.   
The default, 64, has historically proven sufficient, but you might need to raise this value if you have clients that touch many different tables in a single transaction.   
This parameter can only be set at server start.  
  
Increasing this parameter might cause PostgreSQL to request more System V shared memory than your operating system's default configuration allows.   
See Section 17.4.1 for information on how to adjust those parameters, if necessary.  
  
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server.   
Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.
