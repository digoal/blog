## 正文  
PostgreSQL的流复制应用非常普遍, 同时也可以作为HA的关键技术, 当主节点出现故障时, 可以通过激活备节点的方法达到高可用到目的.  
  
当备份节点激活后, 原来的主节点可以作为备节点来使用.   
  
但是, 如果主节点在发生故障前的WAL没有全部同步给备节点的话, 备节点激活后, 实际上与主节点是存在一定差异的. 这种情况下主节点不能直接作为备节点参与利用流复制做的增量恢复.  遇到这样的情况怎么样把主节点变成备节点呢?  
  
1\. 使用pg_basebackup, 或者COPY 的方法重新做一个standby, 这样的话相当于要把整个数据库的数据文件全部传一遍. 数据量大或者网络交差的话是比较痛苦的事情.  
  
2\. 使用rsync, 只传输增量数据, 但是需要注意的是, 如果数据库很大的话, rsync的数据比对过程非常漫长, 并且要消耗大量的io资源.  
  
除了以上两种方法, 还有其他的工具可以利用, 例如在此前写过一篇关于fail-back的工具pg_rewind的使用文章.   
  
pg_rewind利用新的primary的history 文件, 取出切换时间线是的xlog位置信息, 用这个位置信息来匹配旧的primary节点的xlog文件中的信息, 如果旧的primary在这个点之后还产生了xlog信息, 那么说明standby在promote后有未同步至standby节点的xlog数据, 所以需要对这部分xlog做差异处理. 把这部分xlog对应的变更的块以及控制文件,clog等从新的primary拷贝到老的primary节点.   
  
具体可参考 :

除了pg_rewind, PostgreSQL可能在内核中加入类似pg_rewind的功能, 当然原理完全不一样, 加入内核的功能原理如下 :   
  
```  
The proposal is based on the concept of master should not do any file  
system level change until corresponding WAL record is replicated to the  
standby.  
  
There are many places in the code which need to be handled to support the  
proposed solution.  Following cases explains the need of fresh backup at  
the time of failover, and how can we avoid this need by our approach.  
  
1. We must not write any heap pages to the disk before the WAL records  
corresponding to those changes are received by the standby. Otherwise if  
standby failed to receive WAL corresponding to those heap pages there will  
be inconsistency.  
  
2. When CHECKPOINT happens on the master, control file of master gets  
updated and last checkpoint record is written to it. Suppose failover  
happens and standby fails to receive the WAL record corresponding to  
CHECKPOINT, then master and standby has inconsistent copies of control file  
that leads to the mismatch in redo record and recovery will not start  
normally. To avoid this situation we must not update the control file of  
master before the corresponding checkpoint WAL record is received by the  
standby  
  
3. Also when we truncate any of the physical files on the master and  
suppose the standby failed to receive corresponding WAL, then that physical  
file is truncated on master but still available on standby causing  
inconsistency. To avoid this we must not truncate physical files on the  
master before the WAL record corresponding to that operation is received by  
the standby.  
  
4. Same case applies to CLOG pages. If CLOG page is written to the disk and  
corresponding WAL record is not replicated to the standby, leads to the  
inconsistency. So we must not write the CLOG pages (and may be other SLRU  
pages too) to the disk before the corresponding WAL records are received by  
standby.  
  
5. The same problem applies for the commit hint bits. But it is more  
complicated than the other problems, because no WAL records are generated  
for that, hence we cannot apply the same above method, that is wait for  
corresponding WAL record to be replicated on standby.  So we delay the  
processes of updating the commit hint bits, similar to what is done by  
asynchronous commits.  In other words we need to check if the WAL  
corresponding to the transaction commit is received by the failback safe  
standby and then only allow hint bit updates.  
  
*Patch explanation:*  
  
The initial work on this patch is done by Pavan Deolasee. I tested it and  
will make further enhancements based on the community feedback.  
  
This patch is not complete yet, but I plan to do so with the help of this  
community. At this point, the primary purpose is to understand the  
complexities and get some initial performance numbers to alleviate some of  
the concerns raised by the community.  
  
There are two GUC parameters which supports this failsafe standby  
  
1. failback_safe_standby_name  [ name of the failsafe standby ] It is the  
name of failsafe standby. Master will not do any file system level change  
before corresponding WAL is replicated on the this failsafe standby  
  
2. failback_safe_standby_mode  [ off/remote_write/remote_flush] This  
parameter specifies the behavior of master i.e. whether it should wait for  
WAL to be written on standby or WAL to be flushed on standby.  We should  
turn it off when we do not want the failsafe standby. This failsafe mode  
can be combined with synchronous as well as asynchronous streaming  
replication.  
  
Most of the changes are done in the syncrep.c. This is a slight misnomer  
because that file deals with synchronous standby and a failback standby  
could and most like be a async standby. But keeping the changes this way  
has ensured that the patch is easy to read. Once we have acceptance on the  
approach, the patch can be modified to reorganize the code in a more  
logical way.  
  
The patch adds a new state SYNC_REP_WAITING_FOR_FAILBACK_SAFETY to the sync  
standby states. A backend which is waiting for a failback safe standby to  
receive WAL records, will wait in this state.  Failback safe mechanism can  
work in two different modes, that is wait for WAL to be written or flushed  
on failsafe standby. That is represented by two new modes  
SYNC_REP_WAIT_FAILBACK_SAFE_WRITE and SYNC_REP_WAIT_FAILBACK_SAFE_FLUSH  
respectively.  
  
Also the SyncRepWaitForLSN() is changed for conditional wait. So that we  
can delay hint bit updates on master instead of blocking the wait for the  
failback safe standby to receiver WAL's.  
```  
  
到第四版的补丁, 新增的参数名更改为synchronous_transfer, 可配置3个值 :   
  
```  
synchronous_transfer = commit   # data page synchronization level  
                                # commit, data_flush or all  
```  
  
synchronous_transfer参数的含义 :   
  
```  
-'commit'  
    'commit' means that master waits for corresponding WAL to flushed  
to disk of standby server on commits.  
    but master doesn't waits for replicated data pages.  
  
  -'data_flush'  
    'data_flush' means that master waits for replicated data page  
(e.g, CLOG, pg_control) before flush to disk of master server.  
    but if user set to 'data_flush' to this parameter,  
'synchronous_commit' values is ignored even if user set  
'synchronous_commit'.  
  
  -'all'  
    'all' means that master waits for replicated WAL and data page.  
```  
  
commit类似同步流复制,记录master节点的commit状态前,等待该xlog已经在standby flushed to disk.   
  
data_flush则表示master节点在flush data page前, 必须确保这些变更对应的xlog信息已经在standby 节点flush to disk了. (这个配置将忽略synchronous_commit的配置)  
  
同步流复制增加1种等待模式(SYNC_REP_WAIT_DATA_FLUSH) :

测试完后, 在主节点执行checkpoint; 因为配置了synchronous_transfer = data_flush. 会出现等待状态!  
  
```  
postgres: checkpointer process    waiting for 0/2D0C99D8  
```  
  
此时停主库也是无法停止的, 也有flush的动作, 所以会等待.

## 其他  
1\. 加入data_flush后 , 需要特别注意等待事件, 如果standby正常的话, 影响不大, 如果standby 性能不行或者standby 挂了, 就如同sync replication一样会带来堵塞.  
  
2\. 如果配置了synchronous_transfer = data_flush|all, 在没有已经连上来的其他standby节点的情况下, 使用pg_basebackup创建standby会处于等待状态, 因为pg_basebackup需要在master节点执行checkpoint.  
  
3\. 使用异步流复制的情况下, 测试synchronous_transfer = data_flush, all都不能完成主节点的failback.  
  
4\. 使用同步流复制的情况下, 测试synchronous_transfer = data_flush, all可以完成正常的主节点的failback.

7\. 第4版补丁synchronous_transfer参数介绍  
  
```  
we support following 2 cases.  
1\. SYNC server and also make same failback safe standby server  
2\. ASYNC server and also make same failback safe standby server  
  
1.  changed name of parameter  
  give up 'failback_safe_standby_names' parameter from the first patch.  
  and changed name of parameter from 'failback_safe_mode ' to  
'synchronous_transfer'.  
  this parameter accepts 'all', 'data_flush' and 'commit'.  
  
  -'commit'  
    'commit' means that master waits for corresponding WAL to flushed  
to disk of standby server on commits.  
    but master doesn't waits for replicated data pages.  
  
  -'data_flush'  
    'data_flush' means that master waits for replicated data page  
(e.g, CLOG, pg_control) before flush to disk of master server.  
    but if user set to 'data_flush' to this parameter,  
'synchronous_commit' values is ignored even if user set  
'synchronous_commit'.  
  
  -'all'  
    'all' means that master waits for replicated WAL and data page.  
  
2. put SyncRepWaitForLSN() function into XLogFlush() function  
  we have put SyncRepWaitForLSN() function into XLogFlush() function,  
and change argument of XLogFlush().  
  
they are setup case and need to set parameters.  
  
- SYNC server and also make same failback safe standgy server (case 1)  
  synchronous_transfer = all  
  synchronous_commit = remote_write/on  
  synchronous_standby_names = <ServerName>  
  
- ASYNC server and also make same failback safe standgy server (case 2)  
  synchronous_transfer = data_flush  
  (synchronous_commit values is ignored)  
  
- default SYNC replication  
  synchronous_transfer = commit  
  synchronous_commit = on  
  synchronous_standby_names = <ServerName>  
  
- default ASYNC replication  
  synchronous_transfer = commit  
  
ToDo  
1. currently this patch supports synchronous transfer. so we can't set  
different synchronous transfer mode to each server.  
    we need to improve the patch for support following cases.  
   - SYNC standby and make separate ASYNC failback safe standby  
   - ASYNC standby and make separate ASYNC failback safe standby  
  
2. we have not measure performance yet. we need to measure perfomance.  
  
please give me your feedback.
