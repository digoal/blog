## 背景     
本文要聊的是如何利用统计信息规避一些复杂的精确统计.   
  
去年写过一篇关于 PostgreSQL 9.2 新增array元素统计收集的相关文章. 本文也会讲到.  
  
[《PostgreSQL 9.2 add array elements statistics》](../201205/20120518_01.md)    
  
```  
Release 9.2  
  
Release Date: 2012-09-10  
     * Move the frequently accessed members of the PGPROC shared memory  
       array to a separate array (Pavan Deolasee, Heikki Linnakangas,  
       Robert Haas)  
```  
  
在日常的数据库统计中, count(*), 排名这类的统计非常多, 同时这类统计的开销也非常大, 特别是当表的数据量巨大时.  
  
接下来模拟几个场景.  
  
1\. 统计某条件下的记录条数.  
  
```  
digoal=# create table test_1 (id serial4 primary key, info text, appid int, crt_time timestamp);  
CREATE TABLE  
digoal=# insert into test_1 (info,appid,crt_time) select md5(random()::text),round(10000*random())::int,clock_timestamp() from generate_series(1,2000000);  
INSERT 0 2000000  
```  
  
默认的统计目标值为100  
  
```  
digoal=# show default_statistics_target ;  
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------------+----  
default_statistics_target | 100  
digoal=# analyze test_1;  
ANALYZE  
```  
  
为了得到准确的统计信息, 如果没有打开autovacuum, 最好手动收集一次统计信息.  
  
```  
digoal=# select * from pg_stat_all_tables where relname='test_1';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+------------------------------  
relid             | 91368  
schemaname        | public  
relname           | test_1  
seq_scan          | 1  
seq_tup_read      | 0  
idx_scan          | 0  
idx_tup_fetch     | 0  
n_tup_ins         | 2000000  
n_tup_upd         | 0  
n_tup_del         | 0  
n_tup_hot_upd     | 0  
n_live_tup        | 2000000  
n_dead_tup        | 0  
last_vacuum       |   
last_autovacuum   |   
last_analyze      | 2013-08-11 11:15:04.975523+08  
last_autoanalyze  | 2013-08-11 11:14:53.663951+08  
vacuum_count      | 0  
autovacuum_count  | 0  
analyze_count     | 1  
autoanalyze_count | 1  
```  
  
查询appid=1的记录数有多少  
  
```  
digoal=# select count(*) from test_1 where appid=1;  
 count   
-------  
   189  
(1 row)  
```  
  
使用explain输出appid=1的记录数有多少, 这里显示为197. 和使用count(*)得到的存在一点差异.  
  
```  
digoal=# explain select * from test_1 where appid=1;  
                         QUERY PLAN                            
-------------------------------------------------------------  
 Seq Scan on test_1  (cost=0.00..45619.00 rows=197 width=49)  
   Filter: (appid = 1)  
(2 rows)  
```  
  
如果将统计目标调整为10000, 采样行数会大大增加, 消耗的资源加大.   
  
```  
digoal=# alter table test_1 alter column appid SET STATISTICS 10000;  
ALTER TABLE  
digoal=# analyze verbose test_1;  
INFO:  analyzing "public.test_1"  
INFO:  "test_1": scanned 20619 of 20619 pages, containing 2000000 live rows and 0 dead rows; 2000000 rows in sample, 2000000 estimated total rows  
ANALYZE  
```  
  
但是统计行数更加准确了, 现在为188. 只相差1行.   
  
```  
digoal=# explain select * from test_1 where appid=1;  
                         QUERY PLAN                            
-------------------------------------------------------------  
 Seq Scan on test_1  (cost=0.00..45619.00 rows=188 width=49)  
   Filter: (appid = 1)  
(2 rows)  
```  
  
范围查询看看是否准确呢?  
  
```  
digoal=# explain select * from test_1 where appid>1000;  
                           QUERY PLAN                              
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
 Seq Scan on test_1  (cost=0.00..45619.00 rows=1800419 width=49)  
   Filter: (appid > 1000)  
(2 rows)  
```  
  
也非常准确.   
  
```  
digoal=# select count(*) from test_1 where appid>1000;  
  count    
---------  
 1800263  
(1 row)  
```  
  
误差为 : 0.00008665  
  
组合条件的输出行评估 :   
  
```  
digoal=# explain select * from test_1 where appid>1000 and crt_time>now();  
                         QUERY PLAN                            
-------------------------------------------------------------  
 Seq Scan on test_1  (cost=0.00..55619.00 rows=180 width=49)  
   Filter: ((appid > 1000) AND (crt_time > now()))  
(2 rows)  
digoal=# select * from test_1 where appid>1000 and crt_time>now();  
 id | info | appid | crt_time   
----+------+-------+----------  
(0 rows)  
```  
  
2\. 分组排行, 例如要查询哪个appid的记录条数最多.  
  
```  
digoal=# alter table test_1 alter column appid SET STATISTICS 100;  
ALTER TABLE  
digoal=# analyze verbose test_1;  
INFO:  analyzing "public.test_1"  
INFO:  "test_1": scanned 20619 of 20619 pages, containing 2000000 live rows and 0 dead rows; 30000 rows in sample, 2000000 estimated total rows  
ANALYZE  
digoal=# select most_common_vals,most_common_freqs from pg_stats where tablename='test_1' and attname='appid';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```  
  
值太均匀, 所以这个不准确.  
  
```

3\. 数组的元素值排行统计  
  
例如有一个表中记录了客户允许的应用程序信息, 应用程序存储为一个数组, 程序以id形式存到数组中.  
  
如果要统计全国终端中最火爆的程序排行.   
  
```  
digoal=# create table test_2(id serial primary key, appid int[], crt_time timestamp);  
CREATE TABLE  
```  
  
假设appid为0-10的程序比较火爆, 模拟100秒插入请求.  
  
```  
vi test.sql  
insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(10*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;

tps = 3896.755035 (including connections establishing)  
tps = 3897.686073 (excluding connections establishing)  
statement latencies in milliseconds:  
        4.103117        insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(10*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
```  
  
假设appid为10以上的程序不火爆,  模拟10秒插入请求.  
  
```  
vi test.sql  
insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(1000*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pgbench -M prepared -n -r -f ./test.sql -c 16 -j 4 -T 10 digoal

```  
  
总记录数如下 :   
  
```  
digoal=# select count(*) from test_2;  
 count    
--------  
 472583  
(1 row)  
```  
  
收集统计信息  
  
```  
digoal=# analyze verbose test_2;  
INFO:  analyzing "public.test_2"  
INFO:  "test_2": scanned 8184 of 8184 pages, containing 472583 live rows and 0 dead rows; 30000 rows in sample, 472583 estimated total rows  
ANALYZE  
```  
  
通过group by和order by获取实际的排名 :   
  
```  
digoal=# select appid,count(*) from (select unnest(appid) as appid from test_2) t group by appid order by count(*) desc limit 20;  
 appid | count    
-------+--------  
     9 | 872831  
     6 | 871908  
     3 | 871867  
     7 | 871551  
     8 | 871436  
     4 | 871391  
     1 | 871051  
     5 | 870770  
     2 | 870692  
    10 | 435583  
     0 | 435342  
   387 |    831  
    69 |    824  
   665 |    822  
   703 |    816  
   651 |    811  
   520 |    809  
   435 |    809  
   783 |    806  
   671 |    806  
(20 rows)  
```  
  
接下来要用9.2新增的array 统计信息查看排名了 :   
  
注意元素的收集个数为default_statistics_target 的10倍, 这个可以参考源码 :   
  
```  
+   /*  
+    * Set up static pointer for use by subroutines.  We wait till here in  
+    * case std_compute_stats somehow recursively invokes us (probably not  
+    * possible, but ...)  
+    */  
+   array_extra_data = extra_data;  
+  
+   /*  
+    * We want statistics_target * 10 elements in the MCELEM array. This  
+    * multiplier is pretty arbitrary, but is meant to reflect the fact that  
+    * the number of individual elements tracked in pg_statistic ought to be  
+    * more than the number of values for a simple scalar column.  
+    */  
+   num_mcelem = stats->attr->attstattarget * 10;  
```  
  
所以默认default_statistics_target=100的情况下, 将会收集1000个数组型元素的出现概率.  
  
```  
digoal=# select array_length(most_common_elems,1),array_length(most_common_elem_freqs,1) from pg_stats where tablename='test_2' and attname='appid';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----  
array_length | 1000  
array_length | 1003  
most_common_elem_freqs中最后3个的值代表min, max, null_freqs. 具体见  
```  
  
[《PostgreSQL 9.2 add array elements statistics》](../201205/20120518_01.md)    
  
如果把统计信息修改为50, 那么统计信息的元素个数将变成500.  
  
```  
digoal=# alter table test_2 alter column appid set statistics 50;  
ALTER TABLE  
digoal=# analyze verbose test_2;  
INFO:  analyzing "public.test_2"  
INFO:  "test_2": scanned 8184 of 8184 pages, containing 472583 live rows and 0 dead rows; 30000 rows in sample, 472583 estimated total rows

digoal=# select array_length(most_common_elems,1),array_length(most_common_elem_freqs,1) from pg_stats where tablename='test_2' and attname='appid';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]+----  
array_length | 500  
array_length | 503  
```

非常OK , 这对于大数据的统计来说, 无疑是非常重要的参考.  
  
## 注意  
1\. 数据统计信息, 占用空间超过ARRAY_WIDTH_THRESHOLD的数组不会进入统计范畴.  
  
src/backend/utils/adt/array_typanalyze.c  
  
```  
+/*  
+ * To avoid consuming too much memory, IO and CPU load during analysis, and/or  
+ * too much space in the resulting pg_statistic rows, we ignore arrays that  
+ * are wider than ARRAY_WIDTH_THRESHOLD (after detoasting!).  Note that this  
+ * number is considerably more than the similar WIDTH_THRESHOLD limit used  
+ * in analyze.c's standard typanalyze code.  
+ */  
+#define ARRAY_WIDTH_THRESHOLD 0x10000  
....  
+       /* Skip too-large values. */  
+       if (toast_raw_datum_size(value) > ARRAY_WIDTH_THRESHOLD)  
+           continue;  
+       else  
+           analyzed_rows++;  
```
