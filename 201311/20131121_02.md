## 背景   
```  
本文的例子 可用于判断程序性能问题是否由于futex锁冲突引起的.  
This section describes how to identify contended user-space locks throughout the system within a specific time period. The ability to identify contended user-space locks can help you investigate poor program performance that you suspect may be caused by futex contentions.  
Simply put, futex contention occurs when multiple processes are trying to access the same lock variable at the same time. This can result in a poor performance because the lock serializes execution; one process obtains the lock while the other processes must wait for the lock variable to become available again.

FUTEX(2)                   Linux Programmer’s Manual                  FUTEX(2)  
  
NAME  
       futex - Fast Userspace Locking system call  
  
SYNOPSIS  
       #include <linux/futex.h>  
       #include <sys/time.h>  
  
       int futex(int *uaddr, int op, int val, const struct timespec *timeout,  
                 int *uaddr2, int val3);  
  
DESCRIPTION  
       The futex() system call provides a method for a program to wait for a value at a given address to change, and a  
       method to wake up anyone waiting on a particular address (while the addresses for the same memory  in  separate  
       processes  may  not  be equal, the kernel maps them internally so the same memory mapped in different locations  
       will correspond for futex() calls).  It is typically used to implement the contended case of a lock  in  shared  
       memory, as described in futex(7).  
  
       When  a  futex(7)  operation  did not finish uncontended in userspace, a call needs to be made to the kernel to  
       arbitrate.  Arbitration can either mean putting the calling process to sleep or, conversely, waking  a  waiting  
       process.  
  
       Callers  of  this  function are expected to adhere to the semantics as set out in futex(7).  As these semantics  
       involve writing non-portable assembly instructions, this in turn probably means that most users will in fact be  
       library authors and not general application developers.  
  
       The  uaddr argument needs to point to an aligned integer which stores the counter.  The operation to execute is  
       passed via the op argument, along with a value val.  
  
       Five operations are currently defined:  
  
       FUTEX_WAIT  
              This operation atomically verifies that the futex address uaddr still contains the value val, and sleeps  
              awaiting  FUTEX_WAKE  on this futex address.  If the timeout argument is non-NULL, its contents describe  
              the maximum duration of the wait, which is infinite  otherwise.   The  arguments  uaddr2  and  val3  are  
              ignored.  
              For  futex(7),  this  call  is executed if decrementing the count gave a negative value (indicating con-  
              tention), and will sleep until another process releases the futex and executes the FUTEX_WAKE operation.  
  
       FUTEX_WAKE  
              This operation wakes at most val processes waiting on this futex address (i.e., inside FUTEX_WAIT).  The  
              arguments timeout, uaddr2 and val3 are ignored.  
  
              For futex(7), this is executed if incrementing the count showed that there were waiters, once the  futex  
              value has been set to 1 (indicating that it is available).  
  
       FUTEX_FD (present up to and including Linux 2.6.25)  
              To  support  asynchronous wakeups, this operation associates a file descriptor with a futex.  If another  
              process executes a FUTEX_WAKE, the process will receive the signal number that was passed in  val.   The  
              calling  process  must  close the returned file descriptor after use.  The arguments timeout, uaddr2 and  
              val3 are ignored.  
  
              To prevent race conditions, the caller should test if the futex has been upped after FUTEX_FD returns.  
  
              Because it was inherently racy, FUTEX_FD has been removed from Linux 2.6.26 onwards.  
  
       FUTEX_REQUEUE (since Linux 2.5.70)  
              This operation was introduced in order to avoid a "thundering herd" effect when FUTEX_WAKE is  used  and  
              all  processes  woken  up need to acquire another futex.  This call wakes up val processes, and requeues  
              all other waiters on the futex at address uaddr2.  The arguments timeout and val3 are ignored.  
  
       FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE (since Linux 2.6.7)  
              There was a race in the intended use of FUTEX_REQUEUE, so FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE  was  introduced.   This  is  
              similar to FUTEX_REQUEUE, but first checks whether the location uaddr still contains the value val3.  If  
              not, the operation fails with the error EAGAIN.  The argument timeout is ignored.  
  
RETURN VALUE  
       Depending on which operation was executed, the returned value for a successful call can  have  differing  mean-  
       ings.  
  
       FUTEX_WAIT  
              Returns  0  if the process was woken by a FUTEX_WAKE call.  In case of timeout, the operation fails with  
              the error ETIMEDOUT.  If the futex was not equal to the expected value, the  operation  fails  with  the  
              error  EWOULDBLOCK.  Signals (see signal(7)) or other spurious wakeups cause FUTEX_WAIT to fail with the  
              error EINTR.  
  
       FUTEX_WAKE  
              Returns the number of processes woken up.  
  
       FUTEX_FD  
              Returns the new file descriptor associated with the futex.  
  
       FUTEX_REQUEUE  
              Returns the number of processes woken up.  
  
       FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE  
              Returns the number of processes woken up.  
  
       In the event of an error, all operations return -1, and set errno to indicate the error.  
  
ERRORS  
       EACCES No read access to futex memory.  
  
       EAGAIN FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE found an unexpected futex value.  (This  probably  indicates  a  race;  use  the  safe  
              FUTEX_WAKE now.)  
  
       EFAULT Error in getting timeout information from userspace.  
  
       EINVAL An operation was not defined or error in page alignment.  
  
       ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.  
  
       ENOSYS Invalid operation specified in op.  
  
VERSIONS  
       Initial  futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different semantics from what was described above.  A  
       4-argument system call with the semantics given here was introduced in Linux 2.5.40.  In Linux 2.5.70 one argu-  
       ment was added.  In Linux 2.6.7 a sixth argument was added — messy, especially on the s390 architecture.  
  
CONFORMING TO  
       This system call is Linux-specific.  
  
NOTES  
       To  reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy-to-use abstraction for end-users.  (There is no wrapper  
       function for this system call in glibc.)  Implementors are expected to be assembly literate and  to  have  read  
       the sources of the futex userspace library referenced below.

NAME  
       futex - Fast Userspace Locking  
  
SYNOPSIS  
       #include <linux/futex.h>  
  
DESCRIPTION  
       The Linux kernel provides futexes ("Fast Userspace muTexes") as a building block for fast userspace locking and  
       semaphores.  Futexes are very basic and lend themselves well for building  higher  level  locking  abstractions  
       such as POSIX mutexes.  
  
       This  page does not set out to document all design decisions but restricts itself to issues relevant for appli-  
       cation and library development.  Most programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but  instead  rely  
       on system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementation.  
  
       A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between different processes.  In these different  
       processes, it need not have identical addresses.  In its bare form, a futex has semaphore semantics;  it  is  a  
       counter  that  can  be incremented and decremented atomically; processes can wait for the value to become posi-  
       tive.  
  
       Futex operation is entirely userspace for the non-contended case.  The kernel is only involved to arbitrate the  
       contended  case.  As any sane design will strive for non-contention, futexes are also optimized for this situa-  
       tion.  
  
       In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is only touched by atomic assembler  instructions.   Pro-  
       cesses  can share this integer using mmap(2), via shared memory segments or because they share memory space, in  
       which case the application is commonly called multithreaded.  
  
   Semantics  
       Any futex operation starts in userspace, but it may necessary to communicate with the kernel using the futex(2)  
       system call.  
  
       To "up" a futex, execute the proper assembler instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically increment  
       the integer.  Afterwards, check if it has in fact changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters  and  
       the operation is done.  This is the non-contended case which is fast and should be common.  
  
       In  the  contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter from -1  (or some other negative number).  If  
       this is detected, there are waiters.  Userspace should now set the counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to wake  
       up any waiters using the FUTEX_WAKE operation.  
  
       Waiting  on  a futex, to "down" it, is the reverse operation.  Atomically decrement the counter and check if it  
       changed to 0, in which case the operation is done and the futex was uncontended.  In all  other  circumstances,  
       the  process should set the counter to -1 and request that the kernel wait for another process to up the futex.  
       This is done using the FUTEX_WAIT operation.  
  
       The futex(2) system call can optionally be passed a timeout specifying how long the kernel should wait for  the  
       futex  to  be  upped.   In this case, semantics are more complex and the programmer is referred to futex(2) for  
       more details.  The same holds for asynchronous futex waiting.  
  
VERSIONS  
       Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different semantics from those described above.   Cur-  
       rent semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40 onwards.  
  
NOTES  
       To  reiterate,  bare  futexes  are  not intended as an easy to use abstraction for end-users.  Implementors are  
       expected to be assembly literate and to have read the sources of the futex userspace library referenced  below.  
  
       This man page illustrates the most common use of the futex(2) primitives: it is by no means the only one.
