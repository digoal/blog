## 背景
PostgreSQL pg_current_xlog_insert_location() & pg_current_xlog_location() 是两个获取XLOG位置的函数，他们有什么不同呢？    
  
答案是pg_current_xlog_insert_location指写入wal buffer的位置.  
  
pg_current_xlog_location返回已经write到wal文件的位置.  
  
使用异步提交可以看到这个差异.  
  
```
synchronous_commit = off
wal_writer_delay = 10000ms 
```
  
然后开启一个窗口执行一个大批量的写入操作.  
  
在另外的窗口查看这两个函数的结果, fsync明显要小于insert.  
  
```

/*----------
 * Shared-memory data structures for XLOG control
 *
 * LogwrtRqst indicates a byte position that we need to write and/or fsync
 * the log up to (all records before that point must be written or fsynced).
 * LogwrtResult indicates the byte positions we have already written/fsynced.
 * These structs are identical but are declared separately to indicate their
 * slightly different functions.
 *
 * To read XLogCtl->LogwrtResult, you must hold either info_lck or
 * WALWriteLock.  To update it, you need to hold both locks.  The point of
 * this arrangement is that the value can be examined by code that already
 * holds WALWriteLock without needing to grab info_lck as well.  In addition
 * to the shared variable, each backend has a private copy of LogwrtResult,
 * which is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALInsertLock: must be held to insert a record into the WAL buffers.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.
 *
 * CheckpointLock: must be held to do a checkpoint or restartpoint (ensures
 * only one checkpointer at a time; currently, with all checkpoints done by
 * the checkpointer, this is just pro forma).
