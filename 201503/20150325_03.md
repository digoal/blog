## 背景         
将要加入PostgreSQL 9.5了  
  
http://hlinnaka.iki.fi/2015/03/23/pg_rewind-in-postgresql-9-5/  
  
https://github.com/vmware/pg_rewind  
  
在数据库变得比较大时, 例如上TB, 如果部署了PostgreSQL primary-standby 流复制或者log shipping HA.  
  
当发生了failover, old primary节点可能因为某些原因需要重新同步数据.   
  
在广域网上, 由于网络异常也可能造成standby节点落后主节点, 导致需要重新同步数据.  
  
小数据库重新同步数据很方便, 全量或者使用rsync增量同步都可以.   
  
但是数据库很大的情况下, rsync也会变得非常慢, 而且大量消耗主机IO资源.   
  
PostgreSQL 社区有提议在核心中加入通过wal文件解析, 达到增量同步到目的. 目前还在开发阶段.

目前已经有一个工具名为pg_rewind, 也是一个增量同步工具, 具体的做法是通过解析wal, 同步变更过的数据块. 仅仅支持9.3及以上版本. 因为需要data page checksum的支持.  
  
原理如下 :   
  
```  
Theory of operation  
-------------------  
  
The basic idea is to copy everything from the new cluster to old, except   
for the blocks that we know to be the same.  
  
1. Scan the WAL log of the old cluster, starting from the point where  
the new cluster's timeline history forked off from the old cluster. For   
each WAL record, make a note of the data blocks that are touched. This   
yields a list of all the data blocks that were changed in the old   
cluster, after the new cluster forked off.  
  
2. Copy all those changed blocks from the new master to the old master.  
  
3. Copy all other files like clog, conf files etc. from the new cluster  
to old. Everything except the relation files.  
  
4. Apply the WAL from the new master, starting from the checkpoint  
created at failover. (pg_rewind doesn't actually apply the WAL, it just   
creates a backup label file indicating that when PostgreSQL is started,   
it will start replay from that checkpoint and apply all the required WAL)  
```  
  
详细介绍参考此文 :

下面测试一下pg_rewind的强大功能. 测试中包含了standby节点promote后, 主节点和备节点都发生了变更的情况, 当然发生变更产生的wal必须存在. 如果old primary发生的变更已经在归档目录, 需要先手工将这些变更拷贝到pg_xlog目录. 备节点发生的变更无所谓, 因为可以通过recovery.conf来解决.  
  
下载postgresql 9.3 :

4\. 主节点变更为备节点, 一般可以通过rsync从新的主节点(172.16.3.39)来同步$PGDATA, 或者全新的pg_basebackup一次.  
  
本文使用pg_rewind来实现.  
  
  
停原主库(172.16.3.33)  
  
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pg_ctl stop -m fast  
waiting for server to shut down..... done  
server stopped  
```  
  
  
配置.pgpass  
  
```  
su - pg93  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> vi .pgpass  
172.16.3.39:1999:*:postgres:postgres  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> chmod 400 .pgpass  
```  
  
重新同步  
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pg_rewind -D $PGDATA --source-server='host=172.16.3.39 port=1999 dbname=digoal' -v  
connected to remote server  
unexpected control file size 0, expected 8192  
```  
  
多次切换时间线后, 出现如下错误  
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pg_rewind -D $PGDATA --source-server='host=172.16.3.39 port=1999 dbname=digoal' -v  
connected to remote server  
fetched file "global/pg_control", length 8192  
fetched file "pg_xlog/00000006.history", length 213  
could not find common ancestor of the source and target cluster's timelines  
```  
  
在pg_rewind.c中加了一个打印tli信息的代码  
  
```         
       /*  
         * Trace the history backwards, until we hit the target timeline.  
         *  
         * TODO: This assumes that there are no timeline switches on the target  
         * cluster after the fork.  
         */  
        for (i = nentries - 1; i >= 0; i--)  
        {  
                TimeLineHistoryEntry *entry = &sourceHistory[i];  
                fprintf(stdout, "nen:%d,srctli:%d,targettli:%d\n", i, entry->tli, targettli);  
```  
  
重新编译pg_rewind, timeline.c代码有问题, 历史文件解析不正确. 如下 :   
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-39-> pg_rewind -D $PGDATA --source-server='host=172.16.3.33 port=1999 dbname=digoal' -v  
connected to remote server  
fetched file "global/pg_control", length 8192  
fetched file "pg_xlog/0000000B.history", length 419  
nen:1,srctli:11,targettli:10  
nen:0,srctli:1,targettli:10  
could not find common ancestor of the source and target cluster's timelines  
```  
  
使用如下方法修复以上问题.  
  
修改新的主库history文件, 把最后一行放上来即可. 但是紧接着又是前面的错误.unexpected control file size 0, expected 8192, 如下  
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> cd $PGDATA/pg_xlog  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> vi 0000000B.history

9       1/4000090       no recovery target specified  
```  
  
重新执行pg_rewind  
  
```  
pg93@db-172-16-3-39-> pg_rewind -D $PGDATA --source-server='host=172.16.3.33 port=1999 dbname=digoal' -v
