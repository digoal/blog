## 背景                      
PostgreSQL 9.6已支持snapshot too old   
    
前几天写过一篇文章关于如何防止PostgreSQL表膨胀。  
  
其中有一条是避免持有事务排他锁的长事务，因为这个事务开始到结束之间产生的垃圾无法被回收，容易导致膨胀。  
  
[《PostgreSQL 垃圾回收原理以及如何预防膨胀 - How to prevent object bloat in PostgreSQL》](../201504/20150429_02.md)  
  
具体是什么原因呢？  
  
首先看看PostgreSQL垃圾回收代码。  
  
回收垃圾的函数其中之一  
  
src/backend/commands/vacuumlazy.c  
  
在判断一条垃圾记录是否需要回收时，如果发现是HEAPTUPLE_RECENTLY_DEAD的，则不回收。  
  
```  
/*  
 *      lazy_scan_heap() -- scan an open heap relation  
 *  
 *              This routine prunes each page in the heap, which will among other  
 *              things truncate dead tuples to dead line pointers, defragment the  
 *              page, and set commit status bits (see heap_page_prune).  It also builds  
 *              lists of dead tuples and pages with free space, calculates statistics  
 *              on the number of live tuples in the heap, and marks pages as  
 *              all-visible if appropriate.  When done, or when we run low on space for  
 *              dead-tuple TIDs, invoke vacuuming of indexes and call lazy_vacuum_heap  
 *              to reclaim dead line pointers.  
 *  
 *              If there are no indexes then we can reclaim line pointers on the fly;  
 *              dead line pointers need only be retained until all index pointers that  
 *              reference them have been killed.

                                        break;  
```  
  
那么怎么样的垃圾记录是HEAPTUPLE_RECENTLY_DEAD的呢？  
  
首先看看HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum(&tuple, OldestXmin, buf)这个用于判断TUPLE是否满足VACUUM条件的函数  
  
OldestXmin如何获得？  
  
src/backend/commands/vacuum.c  
  
```  
/*  
 * vacuum_set_xid_limits() -- compute oldest-Xmin and freeze cutoff points  
 *  
 * The output parameters are:  
 * - oldestXmin is the cutoff value used to distinguish whether tuples are  
 *       DEAD or RECENTLY_DEAD (see HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum).  
 * - freezeLimit is the Xid below which all Xids are replaced by  
 *       FrozenTransactionId during vacuum.  
 * - xidFullScanLimit (computed from table_freeze_age parameter)  
 *       represents a minimum Xid value; a table whose relfrozenxid is older than  
 *       this will have a full-table vacuum applied to it, to freeze tuples across  
 *       the whole table.  Vacuuming a table younger than this value can use a  
 *       partial scan.  
 * - multiXactCutoff is the value below which all MultiXactIds are removed from  
 *       Xmax.  
 * - mxactFullScanLimit is a value against which a table's relminmxid value is  
 *       compared to produce a full-table vacuum, as with xidFullScanLimit.  
 *  
 * xidFullScanLimit and mxactFullScanLimit can be passed as NULL if caller is  
 * not interested.  
 */  
void  
vacuum_set_xid_limits(Relation rel,  
                                          int freeze_min_age,  
                                          int freeze_table_age,  
                                          int multixact_freeze_min_age,  
                                          int multixact_freeze_table_age,  
                                          TransactionId *oldestXmin,

/*  
 * GetOldestXmin -- returns oldest transaction that was running  
 *                                      when any current transaction was started.  
 *  
 * If rel is NULL or a shared relation, all backends are considered, otherwise  
 * only backends running in this database are considered.  
 *  
 * If ignoreVacuum is TRUE then backends with the PROC_IN_VACUUM flag set are  
 * ignored.  
 *  
 * This is used by VACUUM to decide which deleted tuples must be preserved in  
 * the passed in table. For shared relations backends in all databases must be  
 * considered, but for non-shared relations that's not required, since only  
 * backends in my own database could ever see the tuples in them. Also, we can  
 * ignore concurrently running lazy VACUUMs because (a) they must be working  
 * on other tables, and (b) they don't need to do snapshot-based lookups.  
 *  
 * This is also used to determine where to truncate pg_subtrans.  For that  
 * backends in all databases have to be considered, so rel = NULL has to be  
 * passed in.  
 *  
 * Note: we include all currently running xids in the set of considered xids.  
 * This ensures that if a just-started xact has not yet set its snapshot,  
 * when it does set the snapshot it cannot set xmin less than what we compute.  
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.  
 *  
 * Note: despite the above, it's possible for the calculated value to move  
 * backwards on repeated calls. The calculated value is conservative, so that  
 * anything older is definitely not considered as running by anyone anymore,  
 * but the exact value calculated depends on a number of things. For example,  
 * if rel = NULL and there are no transactions running in the current  
 * database, GetOldestXmin() returns latestCompletedXid. If a transaction      
  
  //  latestCompletedXid集群中最新的已提交事务号，这以后的所有事务  
   //    即使在后来变成垃圾, 也不回收。vacuum不考虑其他未提交事务是否需要看到这些垃圾数据(隔离级别为repeatable read级别及以上的可能会读到)  
  
 * begins after that, its xmin will include in-progress transactions in other  
 * databases that started earlier, so another call will return a lower value.  
 * Nonetheless it is safe to vacuum a table in the current database with the  
 * first result.  There are also replication-related effects: a walsender  
 * process can set its xmin based on transactions that are no longer running  
 * in the master but are still being replayed on the standby, thus possibly  
 * making the GetOldestXmin reading go backwards.  In this case there is a  
 * possibility that we lose data that the standby would like to have, but  
 * there is little we can do about that --- data is only protected if the  
 * walsender runs continuously while queries are executed on the standby.  
 * (The Hot Standby code deals with such cases by failing standby queries  
 * that needed to access already-removed data, so there's no integrity bug.)  
 * The return value is also adjusted with vacuum_defer_cleanup_age, so  
 * increasing that setting on the fly is another easy way to make  
 * GetOldestXmin() move backwards, with no consequences for data integrity.

```  
  
从这里可以了解到，如果记录是在OldestXmin之后申请的事务中变成垃圾的，就是HEAPTUPLE_RECENTLY_DEAD。  
  
也就是说，PostgreSQL垃圾回收时，只是判断TUPLE是否是在当前数据库中的最小的未提交事务或最小的事务快照号之后产生的，如果是，那么就不回收。  
  
在另一篇文章中有介绍如何重现：  
  
[《PostgreSQL 垃圾回收原理以及如何预防膨胀 - How to prevent object bloat in PostgreSQL》](../201504/20150429_02.md)  
  
要解决这个容易膨胀的问题，我们需要知道数据库中存在的最老的未提交的repeatable read或serializable隔离级别的事务号。  
  
用这个事务号作为判断HEAPTUPLE_RECENTLY_DEAD的依据。  
  
例如，当A库中存在级别repeatable read或serializable的最小未结束事务号为Xa, 那么A库中Xa后产生的垃圾不能回收，但是其他库Xa后产生的垃圾能否回收和其他库中的最小repeatable read或serializable未结束事务号有关，和A库无关。
