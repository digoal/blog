## 背景      
数据库可靠性从何而来？        
        
数据库崩溃后如何恢复，从什么位置开始恢复？        
        
数据库检查点是什么？        
        
检查点要干些什么？        
        
为什么脏数据较多时，检查点会对性能有一定的影响？        
        
什么是full page write？        
        
相信这些问题是搞数据库的同学都想搞明白的。        
        
接下里的一系列文章，围绕检查点展开讲解，讲一讲检查点的原理，以及为什么脏数据较多是，它会对数据库产生一定的性能影响。

接着上一篇，  
  
http://blog.163.com/digoal@126/blog/static/1638770402015463252387/  
  
这篇主要谈一下CheckPointBuffers(flags).  
  
CheckPointBuffers(flags)@src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c  
  
```
/*  
 * CheckPointBuffers  
 *  
 * Flush all dirty blocks in buffer pool to disk at checkpoint time.  
 *  
 * Note: temporary relations do not participate in checkpoints, so they don't  
 * need to be flushed.  
 */  
void  
CheckPointBuffers(int flags)  
{  
        TRACE_POSTGRESQL_BUFFER_CHECKPOINT_START(flags);  // buffer checkpoint开始探针  
        CheckpointStats.ckpt_write_t = GetCurrentTimestamp();  
        BufferSync(flags);  //  这个是重量级操作, 需要全扫描1次BUFFER, 锁buffer头, 设置标记。 再扫描一次buffer,将前面标记过的脏块flush到磁盘。  
        CheckpointStats.ckpt_sync_t = GetCurrentTimestamp();  
        TRACE_POSTGRESQL_BUFFER_CHECKPOINT_SYNC_START();   // buffer checkpoint sync开始探针  
        smgrsync();  // sync操作  
        CheckpointStats.ckpt_sync_end_t = GetCurrentTimestamp();  
        TRACE_POSTGRESQL_BUFFER_CHECKPOINT_DONE();   // buffer checkpoint 结束探针  
}   
```
  
BufferSync是一个比较重的操作。  
  
第一次全扫描buffer区，将脏数据块头部设置为本次checkpoint需要flush的块。  
  
第二次扫描，将前面设置为本次需要checkpoint的块FLUSH到磁盘。  
  
但是需要注意，第一次设置为need checkpoint的块，有一个计数，第二次在刷数据块时，可能提前到达这个计数，所以第二次刷脏块的动作可能不需要扫全缓存区域。  
  
但是，第一次被标记的脏块，也可能在这期间被其他进程如bgwriter写掉了，所以第二次扫描时无法达到计数，则还是需要全扫描整个缓存区。  
  
（为什么不在第一次设置时同时记住脏块的内存位置，第二次直接去FLUSH这些位置的块呢？还需要重复再扫一次）  
  
BufferSync@src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c  
  
```
/*  
 * BufferSync -- Write out all dirty buffers in the pool.  
 *  
 * This is called at checkpoint time to write out all dirty shared buffers.  
 * The checkpoint request flags should be passed in.  If CHECKPOINT_IMMEDIATE  
 * is set, we disable delays between writes; if CHECKPOINT_IS_SHUTDOWN,  
 * CHECKPOINT_END_OF_RECOVERY or CHECKPOINT_FLUSH_ALL is set, we write even  
 * unlogged buffers, which are otherwise skipped.  The remaining flags  
 * currently have no effect here.

## 小结
checkpointer刷缓存主要分几个步骤，  
  
1\. 遍历shared buffer区，将当前SHARED BUFFER中脏块新增FLAG need checkpoint，  
  
2\. 遍历shared buffer区，将上一步标记为need checkpoint的块write到磁盘，WRITE前需要确保该buffer lsn前的XLOG已经fsync到磁盘，  
  
3\. 将前面的write sync到持久化存储。  
  
具体耗时可以参考期间的探针，或者检查点日志输出。  
  
下一篇讲一下检查点的跟踪。
