postgres@digoal-> FATAL:  XX000: could not map anonymous shared memory: Cannot allocate memory  
HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment exceeded available memory, swap space, or huge pages. To reduce the request size (currently 3322716160 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.  
LOCATION:  CreateAnonymousSegment, pg_shmem.c:398

通过查看meminfo可以得到原因。  
  
```  
CommitLimit: Based on the overcommit ratio ('vm.overcommit_ratio'),  
              this is the total amount of  memory currently available to  
              be allocated on the system. This limit is only adhered to  
              if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in  
              'vm.overcommit_memory').  
              The CommitLimit is calculated with the following formula:  
              CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) *  
              overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages]  
              For example, on a system with 1G of physical RAM and 7G  
              of swap with a `vm.overcommit_ratio` of 30 it would  
              yield a CommitLimit of 7.3G.  
              For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation  
              in vm/overcommit-accounting.  
Committed_AS: The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.  
              The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which  
              has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been  
              "used" by them as of yet. A process which malloc()'s 1G  
              of memory, but only touches 300M of it will show up as  
              using 1G. This 1G is memory which has been "committed" to  
              by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating  
              application. With strict overcommit enabled on the system  
              (mode 2 in 'vm.overcommit_memory'),allocations which would  
              exceed the CommitLimit (detailed above) will not be permitted.  
              This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will  
              not fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been  
              successfully allocated.  
```  
  
依据vm.overcommit_memory设置的值，  
  
当vm.overcommit_memory=0时，不允许普通用户overcommit, 但是允许root用户轻微的overcommit。  
  
当vm.overcommit_memory=1时，允许overcommit.  
  
当vm.overcommit_memory=2时，Committed_AS不能大于CommitLimit。  
  
commit 限制 计算方法  
  
```  
	      The CommitLimit is calculated with the following formula:  
              CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) *  
              overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages]  
              For example, on a system with 1G of physical RAM and 7G  
              of swap with a `vm.overcommit_ratio` of 30 it would  
              yield a CommitLimit of 7.3G.  
[root@digoal postgresql-9.4.4]# free  
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached  
Mem:       1914436     713976    1200460      72588      32384     529364  
-/+ buffers/cache:     152228    1762208  
Swap:      1048572     542080     506492  
[root@digoal ~]# cat /proc/meminfo |grep Commit  
CommitLimit:     2005788 kB  
Committed_AS:     132384 kB  
```  
  
这个例子的2G就是以上公式计算得来。  
  
overcommit限制的初衷是malloc后，内存并不是立即使用掉，所以如果多个进程同时申请一批内存的话，不允许OVERCOMMIT可能导致某些进程申请内存失败，但实际上内存是还有的。所以Linux内核给出了几种选择，2是比较靠谱或者温柔的做法。1的话风险有点大，因为可能会导致OOM。  
  
所以当数据库无法启动时，要么你降低一下数据库申请内存的大小（例如降低shared_buffer或者max conn），要么就是修改一下overcommit的风格。

```  
    MemTotal: Total usable ram (i.e. physical ram minus a few reserved  
              bits and the kernel binary code)  
     MemFree: The sum of LowFree+HighFree  
MemAvailable: An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new  
              applications, without swapping. Calculated from MemFree,  
              SReclaimable, the size of the file LRU lists, and the low  
              watermarks in each zone.  
              The estimate takes into account that the system needs some  
              page cache to function well, and that not all reclaimable  
              slab will be reclaimable, due to items being in use. The  
              impact of those factors will vary from system to system.  
              This line is only reported if sysctl vm.meminfo_legacy_layout = 0  
     Buffers: Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks  
              shouldn't get tremendously large (20MB or so)  
      Cached: in-memory cache for files read from the disk (the  
              pagecache).  Doesn't include SwapCached  
  SwapCached: Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but  
              still also is in the swapfile (if memory is needed it  
              doesn't need to be swapped out AGAIN because it is already  
              in the swapfile. This saves I/O)  
      Active: Memory that has been used more recently and usually not  
              reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.  
    Inactive: Memory which has been less recently used.  It is more  
              eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes  
   HighTotal:  
    HighFree: Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory  
              Highmem areas are for use by userspace programs, or  
              for the pagecache.  The kernel must use tricks to access  
              this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.  
    LowTotal:  
     LowFree: Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that  
              highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the  
              kernel's use for its own data structures.  Among many  
              other things, it is where everything from the Slab is  
              allocated.  Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.  
   SwapTotal: total amount of swap space available  
    SwapFree: Memory which has been evicted from RAM, and is temporarily  
              on the disk  
       Dirty: Memory which is waiting to get written back to the disk  
   Writeback: Memory which is actively being written back to the disk  
   AnonPages: Non-file backed pages mapped into userspace page tables  
AnonHugePages: Non-file backed huge pages mapped into userspace page tables  
      Mapped: files which have been mmaped, such as libraries  
        Slab: in-kernel data structures cache  
SReclaimable: Part of Slab, that might be reclaimed, such as caches  
  SUnreclaim: Part of Slab, that cannot be reclaimed on memory pressure  
  PageTables: amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page  
              tables.  
NFS_Unstable: NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable  
              storage  
      Bounce: Memory used for block device "bounce buffers"  
WritebackTmp: Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers  
 CommitLimit: Based on the overcommit ratio ('vm.overcommit_ratio'),  
              this is the total amount of  memory currently available to  
              be allocated on the system. This limit is only adhered to  
              if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in

              The CommitLimit is calculated with the following formula:  
              CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) *  
              overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages]  
              For example, on a system with 1G of physical RAM and 7G  
              of swap with a `vm.overcommit_ratio` of 30 it would  
              yield a CommitLimit of 7.3G.  
              For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation

Committed_AS: The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.  
              The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which  
              has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been

```  
  
2\. kernel-doc-2.6.32/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting  
  
```  
The Linux kernel supports the following overcommit handling modes  
  
0       -       Heuristic overcommit handling. Obvious overcommits of  
                address space are refused. Used for a typical system. It  
                ensures a seriously wild allocation fails while allowing  
                overcommit to reduce swap usage.  root is allowed to   
                allocate slighly more memory in this mode. This is the   
                default.  
  
1       -       Always overcommit. Appropriate for some scientific  
                applications.  
  
2       -       Don't overcommit. The total address space commit  
                for the system is not permitted to exceed swap + a  
                configurable amount (default is 50%) of physical RAM.  
                Depending on the amount you use, in most situations  
                this means a process will not be killed while accessing  
                pages but will receive errors on memory allocation as  
                appropriate.  
  
The overcommit policy is set via the sysctl `vm.overcommit_memory'.  
  
The overcommit amount can be set via `vm.overcommit_ratio' (percentage)  
or `vm.overcommit_kbytes' (absolute value).  
  
The current overcommit limit and amount committed are viewable in  
/proc/meminfo as CommitLimit and Committed_AS respectively.  
  
Gotchas  
-------  
  
The C language stack growth does an implicit mremap. If you want absolute  
guarantees and run close to the edge you MUST mmap your stack for the   
largest size you think you will need. For typical stack usage this does  
not matter much but it's a corner case if you really really care  
  
In mode 2 the MAP_NORESERVE flag is ignored.   
  
  
How It Works  
------------  
  
The overcommit is based on the following rules  
  
For a file backed map  
        SHARED or READ-only     -       0 cost (the file is the map not swap)  
        PRIVATE WRITABLE        -       size of mapping per instance  
  
For an anonymous or /dev/zero map  
        SHARED                  -       size of mapping  
        PRIVATE READ-only       -       0 cost (but of little use)  
        PRIVATE WRITABLE        -       size of mapping per instance  
  
Additional accounting  
        Pages made writable copies by mmap  
        shmfs memory drawn from the same pool  
  
Status  
------  
  
o       We account mmap memory mappings  
o       We account mprotect changes in commit  
o       We account mremap changes in size  
o       We account brk  
o       We account munmap  
o       We report the commit status in /proc  
o       Account and check on fork  
o       Review stack handling/building on exec  
o       SHMfs accounting  
o       Implement actual limit enforcement  
  
To Do  
-----  
o       Account ptrace pages (this is hard)
