## 背景                     
朋友的一个CASE，在一个查询中为什么group by用到了sort?  
  
其实这也是优化器的选择问题，只要成本最低，就有可能选择sort。  
  
当然如果hashagg的成本更低，那么就会选择hashagg。

/*  
 * cost_sort  
 *        Determines and returns the cost of sorting a relation, including  
 *        the cost of reading the input data.  
 *  
 * If the total volume of data to sort is less than sort_mem, we will do  
 * an in-memory sort, which requires no I/O and about t*log2(t) tuple  
 * comparisons for t tuples.  
 *  
 * If the total volume exceeds sort_mem, we switch to a tape-style merge  
 * algorithm.  There will still be about t*log2(t) tuple comparisons in  
 * total, but we will also need to write and read each tuple once per  
 * merge pass.  We expect about ceil(logM(r)) merge passes where r is the  
 * number of initial runs formed and M is the merge order used by tuplesort.c.  
 * Since the average initial run should be about twice sort_mem, we have  
 *              disk traffic = 2 * relsize * ceil(logM(p / (2*sort_mem)))  
 *              cpu = comparison_cost * t * log2(t)  
 *  
 * If the sort is bounded (i.e., only the first k result tuples are needed)  
 * and k tuples can fit into sort_mem, we use a heap method that keeps only  
 * k tuples in the heap; this will require about t*log2(k) tuple comparisons.  
 *  
 * The disk traffic is assumed to be 3/4ths sequential and 1/4th random  
 * accesses (XXX can't we refine that guess?)  
 *  
 * By default, we charge two operator evals per tuple comparison, which should  
 * be in the right ballpark in most cases.  The caller can tweak this by  
 * specifying nonzero comparison_cost; typically that's used for any extra  
 * work that has to be done to prepare the inputs to the comparison operators.  
 *  
 * 'pathkeys' is a list of sort keys  
 * 'input_cost' is the total cost for reading the input data  
 * 'tuples' is the number of tuples in the relation  
 * 'width' is the average tuple width in bytes  
 * 'comparison_cost' is the extra cost per comparison, if any  
 * 'sort_mem' is the number of kilobytes of work memory allowed for the sort  
 * 'limit_tuples' is the bound on the number of output tuples; -1 if no bound  
 *  
 * NOTE: some callers currently pass NIL for pathkeys because they  
 * can't conveniently supply the sort keys.  Since this routine doesn't  
 * currently do anything with pathkeys anyway, that doesn't matter...  
 * but if it ever does, it should react gracefully to lack of key data.  
 * (Actually, the thing we'd most likely be interested in is just the number  
 * of sort keys, which all callers *could* supply.)
