## 背景       
在前面介绍过PostgreSQL除了XLOG以外，还有一些操作是需要调用fsync的。  
  
[《除了xlog，哪些操作可能还需要fsync ?》](../201509/20150904_01.md)    
  
其中之一是pg_clog，本文主要分析一下pg_clog是在什么时候需要调用fsync的？  
  
引用wiki里的一段pg_clog的介绍。  
  
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hint_Bits  
  
Some details here are in src/backend/access/transam/README:  
  
```  
1. "pg_clog records the commit status for each transaction that has been assigned an XID."  
  
2. "Transactions and subtransactions are assigned permanent XIDs only when/if they   
first do something that requires one   
--- typically, insert/update/delete a tuple, though there are a few other places   
that need an XID assigned."  
  
pg_clog is updated only at sub or main transaction end.   
When the transactionid is assigned the page of the   
clog that contains that transactionid is checked to see if it already exists and if not,   
it is initialised.  
  
pg_clog is allocated in pages of 8kB apiece(其实是和BLOCKSZ一致，所以不一定是8K，见后面的代码分析).   
  
Each transaction needs 2 bits, so on an 8 kB page there is space for 4 transactions/byte * 8k bytes = 32k transactions.  
  
On allocation, pages are zeroed, which is the bit pattern for "transaction in progress".   
  
So when a transaction starts, it only needs to ensure that the pg_clog page   
that contains its status is allocated, but it need not write anything to it.   
  
In 8.3 and later, this happens not when the transaction starts, but when the Xid is assigned   
(i.e. when the transaction first calls a read-write command).   
  
In previous versions it happens when the first snapshot is taken, normally on the   
first command of any type with very few exceptions.  
  
This means that one transaction in every 32K writing transactions *does* have to   
do extra work when it assigns itself an XID, namely create and zero out the next page of pg_clog.   
  
And that doesn't just slow down the transaction in question, but the next few guys   
that would like an XID but arrive on the scene while the zeroing-out is still in progress.   
  
This probably contributes to reported behavior that the transaction execution time   
is subject to unpredictable spikes.  
  
每32K个事务，要扩展一个CLOG PAGE，每次扩展需要填充0，同时需要调用PG_FSYNC，这个相比FSYNC XLOG应该是比较轻量级的。  
但是也可能出现不可预知的响应延迟，因为如果堵塞在扩展CLOG PAGE，所有等待clog PAGE的会话都会受到影响。  
  
这里指当CLOG buffer没有空的SLOT时，会从所有的CLOG buffer SLOT选择一个脏页，将其刷出，这个时候才会产生pg_fsync。  
  
CLOG pages don't make their way out to disk until the internal CLOG buffers are filled, at which point the least recently used buffer there is evicted to permanent storage.  
```  
  
下面从代码中分析一下pg_clog是如何调用pg_fsync刷脏页的。  
  
每次申请新的事务ID时，都需要调用ExtendCLOG，如果通过事务ID计算得到的CLOG PAGE页不存在，则需要扩展，但是并不是每次扩展都需要调用pg_fsync，因为checkpoint会将clog buffer刷到磁盘，除非在申请新的CLOG PAGE时所有的clog buffer都没有刷出脏页，才需要主动选择一个page并调用pg_fsync刷出对应的pg_clog/file。  
  
src/backend/access/transam/varsup.c  
  
```  
/*  
 * Allocate the next XID for a new transaction or subtransaction.  
 *  
 * The new XID is also stored into MyPgXact before returning.  
 *  
 * Note: when this is called, we are actually already inside a valid  
 * transaction, since XIDs are now not allocated until the transaction  
 * does something.  So it is safe to do a database lookup if we want to  
 * issue a warning about XID wrap.  
 */  
TransactionId  
GetNewTransactionId(bool isSubXact)  
{  
......  
        /*  
         * If we are allocating the first XID of a new page of the commit log,  
         * zero out that commit-log page before returning. We must do this while  
         * holding XidGenLock, else another xact could acquire and commit a later  
         * XID before we zero the page.  Fortunately, a page of the commit log  
         * holds 32K or more transactions, so we don't have to do this very often.  
         *  
         * Extend pg_subtrans too.  
         */  
        ExtendCLOG(xid);  
        ExtendSUBTRANS(xid);  
......  
```  
  
ExtendCLOG(xid);扩展clog page，调用TransactionIdToPgIndex计算XID和CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE的余数，如果不为0，则不需要扩展。  
  
src/backend/access/transam/clog.c  
  
```  
#define TransactionIdToPgIndex(xid) ((xid) % (TransactionId) CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE)  
  
/*  
 * Make sure that CLOG has room for a newly-allocated XID.  
 *  
 * NB: this is called while holding XidGenLock.  We want it to be very fast  
 * most of the time; even when it's not so fast, no actual I/O need happen  
 * unless we're forced to write out a dirty clog or xlog page to make room  
 * in shared memory.  
 */  
void  
ExtendCLOG(TransactionId newestXact)  
{  
        int                     pageno;  
  
        /*  
         * No work except at first XID of a page.  But beware: just after  
         * wraparound, the first XID of page zero is FirstNormalTransactionId.  
         */  
        if (TransactionIdToPgIndex(newestXact) != 0 &&    // 余数不为0，说明不需要扩展。  
                !TransactionIdEquals(newestXact, FirstNormalTransactionId))  
                return;  
  
        pageno = TransactionIdToPage(newestXact);

        ZeroCLOGPage(pageno, true);  
  
        LWLockRelease(CLogControlLock);  
}  
```  
  
ZeroCLOGPage(pageno, true);，调用SimpleLruZeroPage，扩展并初始化CLOG PAGE，写XLOG日志。  
  
```

        return slotno;  
}  
```  
  
SimpleLruZeroPage(ClogCtl, pageno);，调用SlruSelectLRUPage(ctl, pageno);，从clog shared buffer中选择SLOT。  
  
src/backend/access/transam/slru.c

SlruSelectLRUPage(SlruCtl ctl, int pageno)，从clog buffer选择一个空的SLOT，如果没有空的SLOT，则需要调用SlruInternalWritePage(ctl, bestvalidslot, NULL);，写shared buffer page。  
  
```  
/*

/*  
 * Number of shared CLOG buffers.  
 *  
 * Testing during the PostgreSQL 9.2 development cycle revealed that on a  
 * large multi-processor system, it was possible to have more CLOG page  
 * requests in flight at one time than the number of CLOG buffers which existed  
 * at that time, which was hardcoded to 8.  Further testing revealed that  
 * performance dropped off with more than 32 CLOG buffers, possibly because  
 * the linear buffer search algorithm doesn't scale well.  
 *  
 * Unconditionally increasing the number of CLOG buffers to 32 did not seem  
 * like a good idea, because it would increase the minimum amount of shared  
 * memory required to start, which could be a problem for people running very  
 * small configurations.  The following formula seems to represent a reasonable  
 * compromise: people with very low values for shared_buffers will get fewer  
 * CLOG buffers as well, and everyone else will get 32.  
 *  
 * It is likely that some further work will be needed here in future releases;  
 * for example, on a 64-core server, the maximum number of CLOG requests that  
 * can be simultaneously in flight will be even larger.  But that will  
 * apparently require more than just changing the formula, so for now we take  
 * the easy way out.

从上面的代码分析，扩展clog page时，如果在CLOG BUFFER中没有EMPTY SLOT，则需要backend process主动刷CLOG PAGE，所以会有调用pg_fsync的动作。  
  
clog page和数据库BLOCKSZ (database block size)一样大，默认是8K（如果编译数据库软件时没有修改的话，默认是8KB），最大可以设置为32KB。  
  
每个事务在pg_clog中需要2个比特位来存储事务信息(xmin commit/abort,xmax commit/abort)。  
  
所以8K的clog page可以存储32K个事务信息，换句话说，每32K个事务，需要扩展一次clog page。  
  
下面的代码是clog的一些常用宏。  
  
src/backend/access/transam/clog.c  
  
```  
/*  
 * Defines for CLOG page sizes.  A page is the same BLCKSZ as is used  
 * everywhere else in Postgres.  
 *  
 * Note: because TransactionIds are 32 bits and wrap around at 0xFFFFFFFF,  
 * CLOG page numbering also wraps around at 0xFFFFFFFF/CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE,  
 * and CLOG segment numbering at  
 * 0xFFFFFFFF/CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE/SLRU_PAGES_PER_SEGMENT.  We need take no  
 * explicit notice of that fact in this module, except when comparing segment  
 * and page numbers in TruncateCLOG (see CLOGPagePrecedes).  
 */  
  
/* We need two bits per xact, so four xacts fit in a byte */  
#define CLOG_BITS_PER_XACT      2  
#define CLOG_XACTS_PER_BYTE 4  
#define CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE (BLCKSZ * CLOG_XACTS_PER_BYTE)  
#define CLOG_XACT_BITMASK       ((1 << CLOG_BITS_PER_XACT) - 1)  
  
#define TransactionIdToPage(xid)         ((xid) / (TransactionId) CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE)  
#define TransactionIdToPgIndex(xid)     ((xid) % (TransactionId) CLOG_XACTS_PER_PAGE)  
#define TransactionIdToByte(xid)          (TransactionIdToPgIndex(xid) / CLOG_XACTS_PER_BYTE)  
#define TransactionIdToBIndex(xid)       ((xid) % (TransactionId) CLOG_XACTS_PER_BYTE)  
```  
  
查看数据库的block size：  
  
```  
postgres@digoal-> pg_controldata |grep block  
Database block size:                  8192  
WAL block size:                       8192  
```  
  
我们可以使用stap来跟踪是否调用pg_fsync，如果你要观察backend process主动刷clog 脏页，可以把checkpoint间隔开大，同时把clog shared buffer pages。你就会观察到backend process主动刷clog 脏页。

前面pgbench的输出看到每秒产生约32000个事务，刚好等于一个clog页的事务数(本例数据块大小为8KB)。  
  
(每个事务需要2个比特位，每个字节存储4个事务信息)  
  
```  
8192*4=32768  
```  
  
如果你需要观察backend process不刷clog buffer脏页的情况。可以把checkpoint 间隔改小，或者手动执行checkpoint，同时还需要把clog buffer pages改大，例如：  
  
```  
Size  
CLOGShmemBuffers(void)  
{  
	return Min(1024, Max(4, NBuffers / 2));  
}  
```  
  
使用同样的stap脚本，你就观察不到backend process主动刷clog dirty page了。  
  
通过以上分析，如果你发现backend process频繁的clog，可以采取一些优化手段。  
  
1\. 因为每次扩展pg_clog文件后，文件大小都会发生变化，此时如果backend process调用pg_fdatasync也会写文件系统metadata journal（以EXT4为例，假设mount参数data不等于writeback），这个操作是整个文件系统串行的，容易产生堵塞。  
  
所以backend process挑选clog page时，不选择最近的page number可以起到一定的效果，（最好是不选择最近的clog file中的pages）。  
  
另一种方法是先调用sync_file_range, SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER，它不需要写metadata。将文件写入后再调用pg_fsync。减少等待data fsync的时间。  
  
2\. pg_clog文件预分配，目前pg_clog单个文件的大小是由CLOGShmemBuffers决定的，为BLOCKSZ的32倍。可以尝试预分配这个文件，而不是每次都扩展，改变它的大小。  
  
3\. 延迟backend process 的 fsync请求到checkpoint处理。
