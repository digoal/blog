## 背景     
本文测试Greenplum的SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE并发性能。  
  
为了方便观察日志，打开SQL审计和时间统计。  
  
```  
$gpconfig -c log_duration -v on  
$gpconfig -c log_statement -v all  
$gpconfig -c log_error_verbosity -v verbose  
$gpconfig -c log_connections -v on  
$gpconfig -c log_disconnections -v on  
$gpstop -u  
```  
  
创建测试表  
  
```  
digoal=# create table test(id int primary key,info text,crt_time timestamp default now()) distributed by(id);  
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "test_pkey" for table "test"  
CREATE TABLE  
```  
  
往test表插入5000万记录  
  
```  
digoal=# create or replace function f_test() returns void as $$                                                                              
declare                                                                                                                             
begin                                                                                                                               
  for i in 1..10 loop                                                                                                               
    execute 'insert into test select generate_series('||(i-1)*5000000+1||','||i*5000000||'),md5(random()::text),clock_timestamp()';  
  end loop;                                                                                                                         
end;

## 并发查询测试  
  
测试case, 基于主键的查询  
  
```  
$cat test.sql  
\setrandom id 1 50000000  
select * from test where id=:id;  
```  
  
使用绑定变量，RT非常高，达到了350毫秒左右，简单的基于主键的查询，不应该这么差。因为直接查询RT只有8毫秒左右。  
  
```

换成非绑定变量的模式，测试结果相对更理想一些。

```  
  
分析为什么查询使用绑定变量会慢？  
  
跟踪任何一个segment，发现使用绑定变量，一个select * from test where id=?查询要执行这么多。  
  
一个segment被连接了两次，并且使用了分布式提交。

使用simple query则不需要分布式提交，但是每个节点还是有一个这样的查询，比如查询表的大小，索引的大小。

update 并发性能分析  
  
使用1个连接或多个连接，最终的TPS几乎一致。和GP在处理update SQL的锁有关。  
  
例如：  
  
会话A  
  
```  
digoal=# begin;  
BEGIN  
digoal=# update test set info=info where id=100000;  
UPDATE 1  
digoal=# select pg_backend_pid();  
 pg_backend_pid   
----------------  
          32357  
(1 row)  
```  
  
会话B  
  
```  
digoal=# update test set info=info where id=100001;  
```  
  
等待。  
  
原因是会话A持有表锁。

## 小结  
1\. 查询，使用绑定变量会产生分布式提交，效率很低；所以查询使用simple query效率(响应时间更快)更高，增加并发可以提高tps。  
  
2\. 更新，持有表级排他锁，是否绑定变量效率都差不多。根据键值更新不会产生分布式事务，但是如果更新的是一个范围，会自动使用分布式事务提交。因为是表级排他锁，所以增加并发不能提高tps。  
  
3\. 删除，持有表级排他锁，是否绑定变量效率都差不多。根据键值删除不会产生分布式事务，但是如果删除的是一个范围，会自动使用分布式事务提交。因为是表级排他锁，所以增加并发不能提高tps。  
  
4\. 插入，是否绑定变量效率都差不多，没有表级排他锁，因此增加并发可以提高tps。
