## 背景                                   
PostgreSQL 的数据可靠性是依赖XLOG的实现的，所有的对数据块的变更操作在write到磁盘前，一定是确保这个变更产生的REDO会先写到XLOG，并保证XLOG已落盘。   
  
也就是说流程是这样的：   
  
1\. 首先将需要变更的块从文件读入shared buffer   
  
![pic](20160503_02_pic_001.png)  
  
2\. 变更shared buffer中block的内容   
  
![pic](20160503_02_pic_002.png)  
  
3\. 将shared buffer中block变更的内容写入XLOG，如果是checkpoint后第一次变更该块，则写full page。（通过参数控制是否要写full page）。   
  
![pic](20160503_02_pic_003.png)  
  
4\. 在bgwriter将shared buffer中的脏块write到os dirty page前，会确保它对应的XLOG已经落盘，通过脏块的LSN来确保。   
  
![pic](20160503_02_pic_004.png)  
  
所以问题来了，如果用户使用了异步提交，即synchronous_commit=off，会怎样呢？   
  
也没有问题，因为在第四步，一定是会保证造成脏页的XLOG是先落盘的。   
  
所以开启synchronous_commit=off，只会造成丢XLOG，绝对不会造成数据不一致。   
  
确保可靠性和一致性的代码如下：  
  
  
```

 * Main entry point for bgwriter process  
 *

 * low-power hibernation mode.  (This happens if the strategy clock sweep

/*

     * transaction has not performed any WAL-logged operation or didn't assign  
     * a xid.  The transaction can end up not writing any WAL, even if it has  
     * a xid, if it only wrote to temporary and/or unlogged tables.  It can  
     * end up having written WAL without an xid if it did HOT pruning.  In  
     * case of a crash, the loss of such a transaction will be irrelevant;  
     * temp tables will be lost anyway, unlogged tables will be truncated and  
     * HOT pruning will be done again later. (Given the foregoing, you might  
     * think that it would be unnecessary to emit the XLOG record at all in  
     * this case, but we don't currently try to do that.  It would certainly  
     * cause problems at least in Hot Standby mode, where the  
     * KnownAssignedXids machinery requires tracking every XID assignment.  It  
     * might be OK to skip it only when wal_level < hot_standby, but for now  
     * we don't.)  
     *  
     * However, if we're doing cleanup of any non-temp rels or committing any  
     * command that wanted to force sync commit, then we must flush XLOG  
     * immediately.  (We must not allow asynchronous commit if there are any  
     * non-temp tables to be deleted, because we might delete the files before  
     * the COMMIT record is flushed to disk.  We do allow asynchronous commit  
     * if all to-be-deleted tables are temporary though, since they are lost
