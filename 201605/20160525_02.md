PostgreSQL 9.6 统计信息收集进程pgstat，增加了等待事件信息的收集，并且用户可以获得backend的等待事件信息。    
  
目前支持的等待事件分类如下    
  
src/include/pgstat.h    
  
```  
/* ----------  
 * Wait Classes  
 * ----------  
 */  
typedef enum WaitClass  
{  
        WAIT_UNDEFINED,  
        WAIT_LWLOCK_NAMED,  
        WAIT_LWLOCK_TRANCHE,  
        WAIT_LOCK,  
        WAIT_BUFFER_PIN  
}       WaitClass;  
```  
  
支持的获取等待事件类别和等待事件信息的函数    
  
src/backend/postmaster/pgstat.c  
  
```  
/* ----------  
 * pgstat_get_wait_event_type() -

 *      Return a string representing the current wait event type, backend is  
 *      waiting on.

        /* report process as not waiting. */  
        if (wait_event_info == 0)  
                return NULL;  
  
        wait_event_info = wait_event_info >> 24;  
        classId = wait_event_info & 0XFF;  
  
        switch (classId)  
        {

详细的等待信息归类和信息见手册    
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/monitoring-stats.html    
  
在pg_stat_activity动态视图中支持的等待事件字段信息如下    
  
wait_event_type    
  
```  
The type of event for which the backend is waiting, if any; otherwise NULL.   
Possible values are:  
  
LWLockNamed:   
The backend is waiting for a specific named lightweight lock. Each such lock protects a particular data structure in shared memory. wait_event will contain the name of the lightweight lock.  
  
LWLockTranche:   
The backend is waiting for one of a group of related lightweight locks. All locks in the group perform a similar function; wait_event will identify the general purpose of locks in that group.  
  
Lock:   
The backend is waiting for a heavyweight lock. Heavyweight locks, also known as lock manager locks or simply locks, primarily protect SQL-visible objects such as tables. However, they are also used to ensure mutual exclusion for certain internal operations such as relation extension. wait_event will identify the type of lock awaited.  
  
BufferPin:   
The server process is waiting to access to a data buffer during a period when no other process can be examining that buffer. Buffer pin waits can be protracted if another process holds an open cursor which last read data from the buffer in question.  
```  
  
wait_event  
  
```  
Wait event name if backend is currently waiting, otherwise NULL.   
See wait_event for details.  
```
