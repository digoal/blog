## 背景  
操作系统为了适应更多的硬件环境，许多初始的设置值，宽容度都很高。    
    
如果不经调整，这些值可能无法适应HPC，或者硬件稍好些的环境。    
    
无法发挥更好的硬件性能，甚至可能影响某些应用软件的使用，特别是数据库。    
    
## 数据库关心的OS内核参数  
512GB 内存为例      
      
1\.     
  
  参数      
  
```    
fs.aio-max-nr  
```    
      
  支持系统      
  
```    
CentOS 6, 7       
```    
      
  参数解释      
  
```    
aio-nr & aio-max-nr:    
.  
aio-nr is the running total of the number of events specified on the    
io_setup system call for all currently active aio contexts.    
.  
If aio-nr reaches aio-max-nr then io_setup will fail with EAGAIN.    
.  
Note that raising aio-max-nr does not result in the pre-allocation or re-sizing    
of any kernel data structures.    
.  
aio-nr & aio-max-nr:    
.  
aio-nr shows the current system-wide number of asynchronous io requests.    
.  
aio-max-nr allows you to change the maximum value aio-nr can grow to.    
```    
      
  推荐设置       
  
```    
fs.aio-max-nr = 1xxxxxx  
.  
PostgreSQL, Greenplum 均未使用io_setup创建aio contexts. 无需设置。    
如果Oracle数据库，要使用aio的话，需要设置它。    
设置它也没什么坏处，如果将来需要适应异步IO，可以不需要重新修改这个设置。   
```    
      
2\.     
  
  参数       
  
```    
fs.file-max  
```    
      
  支持系统      
  
```    
CentOS 6, 7       
```    
      
  参数解释    
  
```  
file-max & file-nr:    
.  
The value in file-max denotes the maximum number of file handles that the Linux kernel will allocate.   
.  
When you get lots of error messages about running out of file handles,   
you might want to increase this limit.    
.  
Historically, the kernel was able to allocate file handles dynamically,   
but not to free them again.     
.  
The three values in file-nr denote :      
the number of allocated file handles ,     
the number of allocated but unused file handles ,     
the maximum number of file handles.     
.  
Linux 2.6 always reports 0 as the number of free    
file handles -- this is not an error, it just means that the    
number of allocated file handles exactly matches the number of    
used file handles.    
.  
Attempts to allocate more file descriptors than file-max are reported with printk,   
look for "VFS: file-max limit <number> reached".    
```  
    
  推荐设置     
  
```  
fs.file-max = 7xxxxxxx  
.  
PostgreSQL 有一套自己管理的VFS，真正打开的FD与内核管理的文件打开关闭有一套映射的机制，所以真实情况不需要使用那么多的file handlers。     
max_files_per_process 参数。     
假设1GB内存支撑100个连接，每个连接打开1000个文件，那么一个PG实例需要打开10万个文件，一台机器按512G内存来算可以跑500个PG实例，则需要5000万个file handler。     
以上设置绰绰有余。     
```  
    
3\.    
  
  参数     
  
```  
kernel.core_pattern  
```  
    
  支持系统    
  
```  
CentOS 6, 7       
```  
    
  参数解释    
  
```  
core_pattern:    
.  
core_pattern is used to specify a core dumpfile pattern name.    
. max length 128 characters; default value is "core"    
. core_pattern is used as a pattern template for the output filename;    
  certain string patterns (beginning with '%') are substituted with    
  their actual values.    
. backward compatibility with core_uses_pid:    
        If core_pattern does not include "%p" (default does not)    
        and core_uses_pid is set, then .PID will be appended to    
        the filename.    
. corename format specifiers:    
        %<NUL>  '%' is dropped    
        %%      output one '%'    
        %p      pid    
        %P      global pid (init PID namespace)    
        %i      tid    
        %I      global tid (init PID namespace)    
        %u      uid    
        %g      gid    
        %d      dump mode, matches PR_SET_DUMPABLE and    
                /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable    
        %s      signal number    
        %t      UNIX time of dump    
        %h      hostname    
        %e      executable filename (may be shortened)    
        %E      executable path    
        %<OTHER> both are dropped    
. If the first character of the pattern is a '|', the kernel will treat    
  the rest of the pattern as a command to run.  The core dump will be    
  written to the standard input of that program instead of to a file.    
```  
    
  推荐设置     
  
```  
kernel.core_pattern = /xxx/core_%e_%u_%t_%s.%p    
.  
这个目录要777的权限，如果它是个软链，则真实目录需要777的权限  
mkdir /xxx  
chmod 777 /xxx  
留足够的空间  
```  
    
4\.     
  
  参数     
  
```  
kernel.sem   
```  
    
  支持系统    
  
```  
CentOS 6, 7       
```  
    
  参数解释    
  
```  
kernel.sem = 4096 2147483647 2147483646 512000    
.  
4096 每组多少信号量 (>=17, PostgreSQL 每16个进程一组, 每组需要17个信号量) ,     
2147483647 总共多少信号量 (2^31-1 , 且大于4096*512000 ) ,     
2147483646 每个semop()调用支持多少操作 (2^31-1),     
512000 多少组信号量 (假设每GB支持100个连接, 512GB支持51200个连接, 加上其他进程, > 51200*2/16 绰绰有余)     
.  
# sysctl -w kernel.sem="4096 2147483647 2147483646 512000"    
.  
# ipcs -s -l    
  ------ Semaphore Limits --------    
max number of arrays = 512000    
max semaphores per array = 4096    
max semaphores system wide = 2147483647    
max ops per semop call = 2147483646    
semaphore max value = 32767    
```  
    
  推荐设置     
  
```  
kernel.sem = 4096 2147483647 2147483646 512000    
.  
4096可能能够适合更多的场景, 所以大点无妨，关键是512000 arrays也够了。    
```  
      
5\.     
  
  参数     
  
```  
kernel.shmall = 107374182    
kernel.shmmax = 274877906944    
kernel.shmmni = 819200    
```  
    
  支持系统    
  
```  
CentOS 6, 7        
```  
    
  参数解释    
  
```  
假设主机内存 512GB    
.  
shmmax 单个共享内存段最大 256GB (主机内存的一半，单位字节)      
shmall 所有共享内存段加起来最大 (主机内存的80%，单位PAGE)      
shmmni 一共允许创建819200个共享内存段 (每个数据库启动需要2个共享内存段。  将来允许动态创建共享内存段，可能需求量更大)     
.  
# getconf PAGE_SIZE    
4096    
```  
    
  推荐设置     
  
```  
kernel.shmall = 107374182    
kernel.shmmax = 274877906944    
kernel.shmmni = 819200    
.  
9.2以及以前的版本，数据库启动时，对共享内存段的内存需求非常大，需要考虑以下几点  
Connections:	(1800 + 270 * max_locks_per_transaction) * max_connections  
Autovacuum workers:	(1800 + 270 * max_locks_per_transaction) * autovacuum_max_workers  
Prepared transactions:	(770 + 270 * max_locks_per_transaction) * max_prepared_transactions  
Shared disk buffers:	(block_size + 208) * shared_buffers  
WAL buffers:	(wal_block_size + 8) * wal_buffers  
Fixed space requirements:	770 kB  
.  
以上建议参数根据9.2以前的版本设置，后期的版本同样适用。

  参数解释    
  
```  
somaxconn - INTEGER    
        Limit of socket listen() backlog, known in userspace as SOMAXCONN.    
        Defaults to 128.    
	See also tcp_max_syn_backlog for additional tuning for TCP sockets.

tcp_max_syn_backlog - INTEGER    
        Maximal number of remembered connection requests, which have not    
        received an acknowledgment from connecting client.    
        The minimal value is 128 for low memory machines, and it will    
        increase in proportion to the memory of machine.    
        If server suffers from overload, try increasing this number.    
```  
    
  推荐设置     
  
```  
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=4xxx    
pgpool-II 使用了这个值，用于将超过num_init_child以外的连接queue。     
所以这个值决定了有多少连接可以在队列里面等待。

.  
        pressure: when amount of memory allocated by TCP exceeds this number    
        of pages, TCP moderates its memory consumption and enters memory    
        pressure mode, which is exited when memory consumption falls    
        under "min".    
.  
        max: number of pages allowed for queueing by all TCP sockets.

  支持系统    
  
```  
CentOS 6, 7         
```  
    
  参数解释    
  
```  
tcp_syncookies - BOOLEAN    
        Only valid when the kernel was compiled with CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES    
        Send out syncookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket    
        overflows. This is to prevent against the common 'SYN flood attack'    
        Default: 1    
.  
        Note, that syncookies is fallback facility.    
        It MUST NOT be used to help highly loaded servers to stand    
        against legal connection rate. If you see SYN flood warnings    
        in your logs, but investigation shows that they occur    
        because of overload with legal connections, you should tune    
        another parameters until this warning disappear.    
        See: tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_synack_retries, tcp_abort_on_overflow.    
.  
        syncookies seriously violate TCP protocol, do not allow    
        to use TCP extensions, can result in serious degradation    
        of some services (f.e. SMTP relaying), visible not by you,    
        but your clients and relays, contacting you. While you see    
        SYN flood warnings in logs not being really flooded, your server    
        is seriously misconfigured.    
.  
        If you want to test which effects syncookies have to your

This is useful for workloads that require low latency memory allocations

for example a realtime application that receives and transmits network traffic    
(causing in-kernel memory allocations) with a maximum total message burst

.  
When overcommit_memory is set to 2, the committed address space is not

Note: overcommit_kbytes is the counterpart of overcommit_ratio. Only one

==============================================================    
.  
overcommit_memory:    
.  
This value contains a flag that enables memory overcommitment.    
.  
When this flag is 0,   
the kernel attempts to estimate the amount    
of free memory left when userspace requests more memory.    
.  
When this flag is 1,   
the kernel pretends there is always enough memory until it actually runs out.    
.  
When this flag is 2,   
the kernel uses a "never overcommit"    
policy that attempts to prevent any overcommit of memory.    
Note that user_reserve_kbytes affects this policy.    
.  
This feature can be very useful because there are a lot of    
programs that malloc() huge amounts of memory "just-in-case"    
and don't use much of it.

The default value is 0.

zone_reclaim_mode:    
.  
Zone_reclaim_mode allows someone to set more or less aggressive approaches to    
reclaim memory when a zone runs out of memory. If it is set to zero then no    
zone reclaim occurs. Allocations will be satisfied from other zones / nodes    
in the system.    
.  
This is value ORed together of    
.  
1       = Zone reclaim on    
2       = Zone reclaim writes dirty pages out    
4       = Zone reclaim swaps pages    
.  
zone_reclaim_mode is disabled by default.  For file servers or workloads    
that benefit from having their data cached, zone_reclaim_mode should be    
left disabled as the caching effect is likely to be more important than    
data locality.    
.  
zone_reclaim may be enabled if it's known that the workload is partitioned    
such that each partition fits within a NUMA node and that accessing remote    
memory would cause a measurable performance reduction.  The page allocator    
will then reclaim easily reusable pages (those page cache pages that are    
currently not used) before allocating off node pages.    
.  
Allowing zone reclaim to write out pages stops processes that are    
writing large amounts of data from dirtying pages on other nodes. Zone    
reclaim will write out dirty pages if a zone fills up and so effectively    
throttle the process. This may decrease the performance of a single process    
since it cannot use all of system memory to buffer the outgoing writes    
anymore but it preserve the memory on other nodes so that the performance    
of other processes running on other nodes will not be affected.    
.  
Allowing regular swap effectively restricts allocations to the local    
node unless explicitly overridden by memory policies or cpuset    
configurations.

ip_local_port_range - 2 INTEGERS  
        Defines the local port range that is used by TCP and UDP to

.  
ip_local_reserved_ports - list of comma separated ranges  
        Specify the ports which are reserved for known third-party

        number 0). Explicit port allocation behavior is unchanged.  
.  
        The format used for both input and output is a comma separated  
        list of ranges (e.g. "1,2-4,10-10" for ports 1, 2, 3, 4 and  
        10). Writing to the file will clear all previously reserved  
        ports and update the current list with the one given in the  
        input.  
.  
        Note that ip_local_port_range and ip_local_reserved_ports  
        settings are independent and both are considered by the kernel  
        when determining which ports are available for automatic port  
        assignments.  
.  
        You can reserve ports which are not in the current  
        ip_local_port_range, e.g.:  
.  
        $ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

        $ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports  
        8080,9148  
.  
        although this is redundant. However such a setting is useful  
        if later the port range is changed to a value that will  
        include the reserved ports.

resource limit.

它还影响security/limits.conf 的文件句柄限制，单个进程的打开句柄不能大于fs.nr_open，所以要加大文件句柄限制，首先要加大nr_open
```
  
  推荐设置
 
``` 
对于有很多对象（表、视图、索引、序列、物化视图等）的PostgreSQL数据库，建议设置为2000万，
例如fs.nr_open=20480000
``` 
  
## 数据库关心的资源限制  
1\. 通过/etc/security/limits.conf设置，或者ulimit设置    
    
2\. 通过/proc/$pid/limits查看当前进程的设置    
  
```  
#        - core - limits the core file size (KB)  
#        - memlock - max locked-in-memory address space (KB)  
#        - nofile - max number of open files  建议设置为1000万 , 但是必须设置sysctl, fs.nr_open大于它，否则会导致系统无法登陆。
#        - nproc - max number of processes  
以上四个是非常关心的配置  
....  
#        - data - max data size (KB)  
#        - fsize - maximum filesize (KB)  
#        - rss - max resident set size (KB)  
#        - stack - max stack size (KB)  
#        - cpu - max CPU time (MIN)  
#        - as - address space limit (KB)  
#        - maxlogins - max number of logins for this user  
#        - maxsyslogins - max number of logins on the system  
#        - priority - the priority to run user process with  
#        - locks - max number of file locks the user can hold  
#        - sigpending - max number of pending signals  
#        - msgqueue - max memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes)  
#        - nice - max nice priority allowed to raise to values: [-20, 19]  
#        - rtprio - max realtime priority  
```  
    
## 数据库关心的IO调度规则  
1\. 目前操作系统支持的IO调度策略包括cfq, deadline, noop 等。    
  
```  
/kernel-doc-xxx/Documentation/block  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root   674 Apr  8 16:33 00-INDEX  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 55006 Apr  8 16:33 biodoc.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root   618 Apr  8 16:33 capability.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 12791 Apr  8 16:33 cfq-iosched.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 13815 Apr  8 16:33 data-integrity.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  2841 Apr  8 16:33 deadline-iosched.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4713 Apr  8 16:33 ioprio.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  2535 Apr  8 16:33 null_blk.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  4896 Apr  8 16:33 queue-sysfs.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  2075 Apr  8 16:33 request.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  3272 Apr  8 16:33 stat.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  1414 Apr  8 16:33 switching-sched.txt  
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  3916 Apr  8 16:33 writeback_cache_control.txt  
```  
  
  如果你要详细了解这些调度策略的规则，可以查看WIKI或者看内核文档。    
    
  从这里可以看到它的调度策略  
  
```  
cat /sys/block/vdb/queue/scheduler   
noop [deadline] cfq   
```  
    
  修改    
  
```  
echo deadline > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler  
```  
    
  或者修改启动参数    
  
```  
grub.conf  
elevator=deadline  
```  
    
  从很多测试结果来看，数据库使用deadline调度，性能会更稳定一些。      
    
## 其他  
1\. 关闭透明大页  
  
2\. 禁用NUMA  
  
3\. SSD的对齐
