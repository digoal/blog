## 背景  
之前写过几篇 PostgreSQL 并行计算的文章，文中并没有仔细描述PostgreSQL是如何决策并行计算，以及并行度的。    
    
* 开源数据库PostgreSQL攻克并行计算难题    
  
https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/44655    
    
* PostgreSQL 并行计算 在 xfs, ext4 下的表现    
  
https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/53985    
    
PostgreSQL 并不需要用户在SQL中使用HINT来启用并行计算，因为优化器会从成本的角度做出选择，是否使用，以及使用的并行度是多大。    
    
## 优化器选择并行计算的相关参数  
PostgreSQL会通过这些参数来决定是否使用并行，以及该启用几个work process。     
    
* max_worker_processes (integer)    
  
  很显然，这个参数决定了整个数据库集群允许启动多少个work process，注意如果有standby，standby的参数必须大于等于主库的参数值。    
  
  如果设置为0，表示不允许并行。    
  
```  
Sets the maximum number of background processes that the system can support.   
This parameter can only be set at server start.   
The default is 8.  
#   
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server.   
Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.  
```  
    
* max_parallel_workers_per_gather (integer)    
  
  这个参数决定了每个Gather node最多允许启用多少个work process。    
      
  同时需要注意，在OLTP业务系统中，不要设置太大，因为每个worker都会消耗同等的work_mem等资源，争抢会比较厉害。    
    
  建议在OLAP中使用并行，并且做好任务调度，减轻冲突。    
  
```  
Sets the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather node.   
Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by max_worker_processes.   
Note that the requested number of workers may not actually be available at run time. -- 因为work process可能被使用了一些，整个系统还能开启的work process=max_worker_processes减去已使用的。    
#   
If this occurs, the plan will run with fewer workers than expected, which may be inefficient.   
The default value is 2.   
Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.   
#   
Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more resources than non-parallel queries, because each worker process is a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the system as an additional user session.   
This should be taken into account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such as work_mem.   
Resource limits such as work_mem are applied individually to each worker, which means the total utilization may be much higher across all processes than it would normally be for any single process.   
For example, a parallel query using 4 workers may use up to 5 times as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which uses no workers at all.  
```  
    
  例子，WITH语法中，有两个QUERY用来并行计算，虽然设置的max_parallel_workers_per_gather=6，但是由于max_worker_processes=8，所以第一个Gather node用了6个worker process，而另一个Gather实际上只用了2个worker。

  表的大小，也作为是否启用并行计算的条件，如果小于它，不启用并行计算。

                                break;                  /* avoid overflow */

//

* force_parallel_mode (enum)  
  
  强制开启并行，可以作为测试的目的，也可以作为hint来使用。      
  
```  
Allows the use of parallel queries for testing purposes even in cases where no performance benefit is expected.   
The allowed values of force_parallel_mode are   
off (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve performance),   
on (force parallel query for all queries for which it is thought to be safe),   
regress (like on, but with additional behavior changes as explained below).   
#   
More specifically, setting this value to on will add a Gather node to the top of any query plan for which this appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker.   
Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used, operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner believes that this will cause the query to fail.   
If failures or unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used by the query may need to be marked PARALLEL UNSAFE (or, possibly, PARALLEL RESTRICTED).  
#   
Setting this value to regress has all of the same effects as setting it to on plus some additional effects that are intended to facilitate automated regression testing.   
Normally, messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that, but a setting of regress suppresses this line so that the output is the same as in non-parallel execution.   
Also, the Gather nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden in EXPLAIN output so that the output matches what would be obtained if this setting were turned off.

* parallel_workers (integer), 正式版本已更名，请注意  
  
```  
max_parallel_workers configuration parameter, Asynchronous Behavior  
max_parallel_workers_per_gather configuration parameter, Asynchronous Behavior  
```  
  
  以上都是数据库的参数，parallel_workers是表级参数，可以在建表时设置，也可以后期设置。    
    
  代码见create_plain_partial_paths()  
  
```  
create table ... WITH( storage parameter ... )    
#   
This sets the number of workers that should be used to assist a parallel scan of this table.   
If not set, the system will determine a value based on the relation size.   
The actual number of workers chosen by the planner may be less, for example due to the setting of max_worker_processes.    
```  
    
  例子  
  
```  
设置表级并行度  
alter table test set (parallel_workers=0);  
#  
关闭表的并行  
alter table test set (parallel_workers=0);  
#  
重置参数，那么在create_plain_partial_paths中会通过表的pages计算出一个合理的并行度  
alter table test reset (parallel_workers);  
```  
    
## PG优化器如何决定使用并行或者如何计算并行度    
其实前面在讲参数时都已经讲到了，这里再总结一下。    
    
1\. 决定整个系统能开多少个worker进程    
  
  max_worker_processes    
    
2\. 计算并行计算的成本，优化器根据CBO原则选择是否开启并行    
  
  parallel_setup_cost    
  
  parallel_tuple_cost    
    
  所以简单QUERY，如果COST本来就很低（比如小于并行计算的启动成本），那么很显然数据库不会对这种QUERY启用并行计算。     
    
3\. 强制开启并行的开关    
  
  force_parallel_mode    
  
  当第二步计算出来的成本大于非并行的成本时，可以通过这种方式强制让优化器开启并行查询。    
  
4\. 根据表级parallel_workers参数决定每个Gather node的并行度    
  
  取min(parallel_workers, max_parallel_workers_per_gather)     
  
  注意正式版本已更名    
  
```  
max_parallel_workers_per_gather (integer)  
Sets the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather node. 
Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by max_worker_processes, 
limited by max_parallel_workers. Note that the requested number of workers may not actually be available at runtime. 
If this occurs, the plan will run with fewer workers than expected, which may be inefficient. 
The default value is 2. Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.  
  
Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more resources than non-parallel queries, 
because each worker process is a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the system as an additional user session. 
This should be taken into account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such as work_mem. 
Resource limits such as work_mem are applied individually to each worker, which means the total utilization may be much higher across all processes than it would normally be for any single process. 
For example, a parallel query using 4 workers may use up to 5 times as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which uses no workers at all.  
  
For more information on parallel query, see Chapter 15, Parallel Query.  
  
max_parallel_workers (integer)  
Sets the maximum number of workers that the system can support for parallel queries. The default value is 8. 
When increasing or decreasing this value, consider also adjusting max_parallel_workers_per_gather. 
Also, note that a setting for this value which is higher than max_worker_processes will have no effect, 
since parallel workers are taken from the pool of worker processes established by that setting.  
```  
  
5\. 当表没有设置parallel_workers参数并且表的大小大于min_parallel_relation_size是，由算法决定每个Gather node的并行度    
  
  相关参数 min_parallel_relation_size    
  
  算法见 create_plain_partial_paths    
  
  取Min(parallel_workers, max_parallel_workers_per_gather)    
    
  注意实际上，每个Gather能开启多少个worker还和PG集群总体剩余可以开启的worker进程数相关。    
  
  因此实际开启的可能小于优化器算出来的。从前面的例子中也可以理解。    
    
6\. 用户也可以使用hint来控制优化器选择是否强制并行 , 参考pg_hint_plan插件的用法。     
  
### 如何通过参数设置开多少个并行
加入我要让某个QUERY开启32个并行，如何设置？  
  
1\. 足够大的max_worker_processes  
  
```
max_worker_processes = 128
```
  
2\. 足够大的max_parallel_workers_per_gather  
  
```
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 32
```
  
3\. 以下设置为0  
  
```
parallel_tuple_cost = 0
parallel_setup_cost = 0
min_parallel_relation_size = 0
```
  
4\. 强制并行  
  
```
force_parallel_mode = on
```
  
5\. 最容易忽视的参数，表级并行度，如果没有设置，内核会根据表的大小算出一个。    
  
```
alter table test set (parallel_workers=32);

用法
设置表级并行度
alter table test set (parallel_workers=0);
#
关闭表的并行
alter table test set (parallel_workers=0);
#
重置参数，那么在create_plain_partial_paths中会通过表的pages计算出一个合理的并行度
alter table test reset (parallel_workers);
```
  
以上设置过后，并行度会强制为32,(当然，表必须要>=32个数据块，否则没法分配任务了).
