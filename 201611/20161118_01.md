## 背景
看刑侦剧经常有看到人物拼图，然后到图库搜索的，以前可能靠的是人肉，今天，使用PG，可以靠数据库的图形近似度搜索功能。  
  
[《弱水三千,只取一瓢,当图像搜索遇见PostgreSQL (Haar wavelet)》](https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/58246)    
  
但是我今天不是写图形搜索，我要写的是文本搜索，文本搜索，大家一定会想到分词。   
      
千万不要以为分词可以搞定一切需求，比如这样的需求就搞不定。   
   
hello world打成了hello word或者hello w0rld，你要让数据库匹配出来，怎么搞？    
   
又或者你的业务需要写正则进行匹配，怎么搞？比如一些域名的查询，www.firefoxcn.org可能你只想输入其中的一个部分来搜索，如果firefox可以匹配。   
   
甚至更变态的 fi[a-z]{1}e.*?\.?? ，这样的查询。   
    
数据量小，并发小时，这种查询是可以忍受全表扫描和CPU处理过滤的。  
  
但是想想一下，你是一个日请求过亿的业务，或者数据量亿级别的，全表扫描和CPU的开销会让你疯掉的。   
  
那么来看看PostgreSQL是如何做到的吧。  
  
PG就像机器猫的百宝箱，里面什么都能找到，一起来召唤。

## PostgreSQL 如何支持正则?  
在pg_trgm的代码注释中有详细的介绍，分为4个步骤。  
  
1\. 使用PostgreSQL regexp库，将正则转换为NFA样式（图形化词组）。   
  
2\. 将NFA样式再进行转换，转换为扩展的图形样式(trigrams)，包括拆分后的查询词组与NOT词组。    
  
3\. 简化，过滤不必要的trigrams。   
  
4\. 打包为TrgmPackedGraph结构，支持GIN,GIST索引的检索。  
  
## 正则查询、模糊查询例子
新建一张测试表，其中包含一个字符串类型字段，插入5000万随机字符串，要来就来大数据量，数据库可不是玩具。    
  
```
postgres=# create extension pg_trgm; 
postgres=# create table tbl(id int primary key, info text, crt_time timestamp); 
postgres=# insert into tbl select id,md5(random()::text), now() from generate_series(1,50000000) t(id); 
```
    
创建支持正则的索引    
    
```
postgres=# CREATE INDEX trgm_idx_tbl_gin ON tbl USING GIN (info gin_trgm_ops);  
```
   
正则查询例子，刚给一位搞其他数据库产品的同学演示过，被查询速度惊吓到，直接给跪了。      
  
```
postgres=# select * from tbl where info ~ '53?6b.*8823a' limit 10;

## 索引优化
由于这里GIN索引是对TOKEN做的，一般来说，如果字符串越长，TOKEN就越多，如果索引字段会更新的话，需要优化一下GIN的异步合并，提升更新的性能。  
  
## 其他
### 相似度查询
相似度，其实是指输错了还能匹配，就好比人物拼图，或者回忆录，你总不能每个细节都记得清楚吧，所以相似度匹配的功能就展露头角了。

GIN indexes accept different parameters:

fastupdate
This setting controls usage of the fast update technique described in Section 63.4.1. 
It is a Boolean parameter: ON enables fast update, OFF disables it. 
(Alternative spellings of ON and OFF are allowed as described in Section 19.1.) The default is ON.

gin_pending_list_limit
Custom gin_pending_list_limit parameter. This value is specified in kilobytes.

 *
 * trgm_regexp.c
 *	  Regular expression matching using trigrams.
 *
 * The general idea of trigram index support for a regular expression (regex)
 * search is to transform the regex into a logical expression on trigrams.
 * For example:
 *
 *	 (ab|cd)efg  =>  ((abe & bef) | (cde & def)) & efg
 *
 * If a string matches the regex, then it must match the logical expression on
 * trigrams.  The opposite is not necessarily true, however: a string that
 * matches the logical expression might not match the original regex.  Such
 * false positives are removed via recheck, by running the regular regex match
 * operator on the retrieved heap tuple.
 *
 * Since the trigram expression involves both AND and OR operators, we can't
 * expect the core index machinery to evaluate it completely.  Instead, the
 * result of regex analysis is a list of trigrams to be sought in the index,
 * plus a simplified graph that is used by trigramsMatchGraph() to determine
 * whether a particular indexed value matches the expression.
 *
 * Converting a regex to a trigram expression is based on analysis of an
 * automaton corresponding to the regex.  The algorithm consists of four
 * stages:
 *
 * 1) Compile the regexp to NFA form.  This is handled by the PostgreSQL
 *	  regexp library, which provides accessors for its opaque regex_t struct
 *	  to expose the NFA state graph and the "colors" (sets of equivalent
 *	  characters) used as state transition labels.
 *
 * 2) Transform the original NFA into an expanded graph, where arcs
 *	  are labeled with trigrams that must be present in order to move from
 *	  one state to another via the arcs.  The trigrams used in this stage
 *	  consist of colors, not characters, as in the original NFA.
 *
 * 3) Expand the color trigrams into regular trigrams consisting of
 *	  characters.  If too many distinct trigrams are produced, trigrams are
 *	  eliminated and the graph is simplified until it's simple enough.
 *
 * 4) Finally, the resulting graph is packed into a TrgmPackedGraph struct,
 *	  and returned to the caller.
 *
 * 1) Compile the regexp to NFA form
 * ---------------------------------
 * The automaton returned by the regexp compiler is a graph where vertices
 * are "states" and arcs are labeled with colors.  Each color represents
 * a set of characters, so that all characters assigned to the same color
 * are interchangeable, so far as matching the regexp is concerned.  There
 * are two special states: "initial" and "final".  A state can have multiple
 * outgoing arcs labeled with the same color, which makes the automaton
 * non-deterministic, because it can be in many states simultaneously.
 *
 * Note that this NFA is already lossy compared to the original regexp,
 * since it ignores some regex features such as lookahead constraints and
 * backref matching.  This is OK for our purposes since it's still the case
 * that only strings matching the NFA can possibly satisfy the regexp.
 *
 * 2) Transform the original NFA into an expanded graph
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * In the 2nd stage, the automaton is transformed into a graph based on the
 * original NFA.  Each state in the expanded graph represents a state from
 * the original NFA, plus a prefix identifying the last two characters
 * (colors, to be precise) seen before entering the state.  There can be
 * multiple states in the expanded graph for each state in the original NFA,
 * depending on what characters can precede it.  A prefix position can be
 * "unknown" if it's uncertain what the preceding character was, or "blank"
 * if the character was a non-word character (we don't need to distinguish
 * which non-word character it was, so just think of all of them as blanks).
 *
 * For convenience in description, call an expanded-state identifier
 * (two prefix colors plus a state number from the original NFA) an
 * "enter key".
 *
 * Each arc of the expanded graph is labelled with a trigram that must be
 * present in the string to match.  We can construct this from an out-arc of
 * the underlying NFA state by combining the expanded state's prefix with the
 * color label of the underlying out-arc, if neither prefix position is
 * "unknown".  But note that some of the colors in the trigram might be
 * "blank".  This is OK since we want to generate word-boundary trigrams as
 * the regular trigram machinery would, if we know that some word characters
 * must be adjacent to a word boundary in all strings matching the NFA.
 *
 * The expanded graph can also have fewer states than the original NFA,
 * because we don't bother to make a separate state entry unless the state
 * is reachable by a valid arc.  When an enter key is reachable from a state
 * of the expanded graph, but we do not know a complete trigram associated
 * with that transition, we cannot make a valid arc; instead we insert the
 * enter key into the enterKeys list of the source state.  This effectively
 * means that the two expanded states are not reliably distinguishable based
 * on examining trigrams.
 *
 * So the expanded graph resembles the original NFA, but the arcs are
 * labeled with trigrams instead of individual characters, and there may be
 * more or fewer states.  It is a lossy representation of the original NFA:
 * any string that matches the original regexp must match the expanded graph,
 * but the reverse is not true.
 *
 * We build the expanded graph through a breadth-first traversal of states
 * reachable from the initial state.  At each reachable state, we identify the
 * states reachable from it without traversing a predictable trigram, and add
 * those states' enter keys to the current state.  Then we generate all
 * out-arcs leading out of this collection of states that have predictable
 * trigrams, adding their target states to the queue of states to examine.
 *
 * When building the graph, if the number of states or arcs exceed pre-defined
 * limits, we give up and simply mark any states not yet processed as final
 * states.  Roughly speaking, that means that we make use of some portion from
 * the beginning of the regexp.  Also, any colors that have too many member
 * characters are treated as "unknown", so that we can't derive trigrams
 * from them.
 *
 * 3) Expand the color trigrams into regular trigrams
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * The trigrams in the expanded graph are "color trigrams", consisting
 * of three consecutive colors that must be present in the string. But for
 * search, we need regular trigrams consisting of characters. In the 3rd
 * stage, the color trigrams are expanded into regular trigrams. Since each
 * color can represent many characters, the total number of regular trigrams
 * after expansion could be very large. Because searching the index for
 * thousands of trigrams would be slow, and would likely produce so many
 * false positives that we would have to traverse a large fraction of the
 * index, the graph is simplified further in a lossy fashion by removing
 * color trigrams. When a color trigram is removed, the states connected by
 * any arcs labelled with that trigram are merged.
 *
 * Trigrams do not all have equivalent value for searching: some of them are
 * more frequent and some of them are less frequent. Ideally, we would like
 * to know the distribution of trigrams, but we don't. But because of padding
 * we know for sure that the empty character is more frequent than others,
 * so we can penalize trigrams according to presence of whitespace. The
 * penalty assigned to each color trigram is the number of simple trigrams
 * it would produce, times the penalties[] multiplier associated with its
 * whitespace content. (The penalties[] constants were calculated by analysis
 * of some real-life text.) We eliminate color trigrams starting with the
 * highest-penalty one, until we get to a total penalty of no more than
 * WISH_TRGM_PENALTY. However, we cannot remove a color trigram if that would
 * lead to merging the initial and final states, so we may not be able to
 * reach WISH_TRGM_PENALTY. It's still okay so long as we have no more than
 * MAX_TRGM_COUNT simple trigrams in total, otherwise we fail.
 *
 * 4) Pack the graph into a compact representation
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * The 2nd and 3rd stages might have eliminated or merged many of the states
 * and trigrams created earlier, so in this final stage, the graph is
 * compacted and packed into a simpler struct that contains only the
 * information needed to evaluate it.
 *
 * ALGORITHM EXAMPLE:
 *
 * Consider the example regex "ab[cd]".  This regex is transformed into the
 * following NFA (for simplicity we show colors as their single members):
 *
 *					  4#
 *					c/
 *		 a	   b	/
 *	 1* --- 2 ---- 3
 *					\
 *					d\
 *					  5#
 *
 * We use * to mark initial state and # to mark final state. It's not depicted,
 * but states 1, 4, 5 have self-referencing arcs for all possible characters,
 * because this pattern can match to any part of a string.
 *
 * As the result of stage 2 we will have the following graph:
 *
 *		  abc	 abd
 *	 2# <---- 1* ----> 3#
 *
 * The process for generating this graph is:
 * 1) Create state 1 with enter key (UNKNOWN, UNKNOWN, 1).
 * 2) Add key (UNKNOWN, "a", 2) to state 1.
 * 3) Add key ("a", "b", 3) to state 1.
 * 4) Create new state 2 with enter key ("b", "c", 4).  Add an arc
 *	  from state 1 to state 2 with label trigram "abc".
 * 5) Mark state 2 final because state 4 of source NFA is marked as final.
 * 6) Create new state 3 with enter key ("b", "d", 5).  Add an arc
 *	  from state 1 to state 3 with label trigram "abd".
 * 7) Mark state 3 final because state 5 of source NFA is marked as final.
