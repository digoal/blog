## 背景    
早上送给大家的新年大礼包，一年一个大版本是PostgreSQL社区的传统，虽然发布时间通常为秋天，还有一段时间，但是已经迫不及待地想看看2017金秋将要发布的10.0版本已经装备了哪些核武器。     
     
放心，还会有一波又一波的feature和增强搭上开往2017金秋的列车，本文提到的可能只是其中的某一节车厢沃，PGer是不是开始有一点振奋人心的感觉啦。    
    
## 1. 并行计算专属动态共享内存区，（加速索引扫描\外部表并行的支持步伐）

```  
Support quorum-based synchronous replication.  
  
This feature is also known as "quorum commit" especially in discussion  
on pgsql-hackers.  
  
This commit adds the following new syntaxes into synchronous_standby_names  
GUC. By using FIRST and ANY keywords, users can specify the method to  
choose synchronous standbys from the listed servers.  
  
  FIRST num_sync (standby_name [, ...])  
  ANY num_sync (standby_name [, ...])  
  
The keyword FIRST specifies a priority-based synchronous replication  
which was available also in 9.6 or before. This method makes transaction  
commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to num_sync  
synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities.  
  
The keyword ANY specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication  
and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are  
replicated to *at least* num_sync listed standbys. In this method,  
the values of sync_state.pg_stat_replication for the listed standbys  
are reported as "quorum". The priority is still assigned to each standby,  
but not used in this method.  
  
The existing syntaxes having neither FIRST nor ANY keyword are still  
supported. They are the same as new syntax with FIRST keyword, i.e.,  
a priorirty-based synchronous replication.

```  
Refactor the code for verifying user's password.  
  
Split md5_crypt_verify() into three functions:  
* get_role_password() to fetch user's password from pg_authid, and check  
  its expiration.  
* md5_crypt_verify() to check an MD5 authentication challenge  
* plain_crypt_verify() to check a plaintext password.  
  
get_role_password() will be needed as a separate function by the upcoming  
SCRAM authentication patch set. Most of the remaining functionality in  
md5_crypt_verify() was different for MD5 and plaintext authentication, so  
split that for readability.  
  
While we're at it, simplify the *_crypt_verify functions by using  
stack-allocated buffers to hold the temporary MD5 hashes, instead of  
pallocing.

Turn password_encryption GUC into an enum.  
  
This makes the parameter easier to extend, to support other password-based  
authentication protocols than MD5. (SCRAM is being worked on.)  
  
The GUC still accepts on/off as aliases for "md5" and "plain", although  
we may want to remove those once we actually add support for another  
password hash type.

https://postgrespro.com/docs/postgresproee/9.6/auth-methods.html#auth-password  
  
```  
21.3.2. Password Authentication  
  
The password-based authentication methods are md5, scram, and password. These methods operate similarly except for the way that the password is sent across the connection, namely MD5-hashed, SCRAM-SHA-256 and clear-text respectively.  
  
If you are at all concerned about password “sniffing” attacks then md5 is preferred. Plain password should always be avoided if possible. However, md5 cannot be used with the db_user_namespace feature. If the connection is protected by SSL encryption then password can be used safely (though SSL certificate authentication might be a better choice if one is depending on using SSL).  
  
scram has more advantages than md5 as it protects from cases where the hashed password is taken directly from pg_authid in which case a connection using only the stolen hash is possible without knowing the password behind it. It protects as well from password interception and data sniffing where the password data could be directly obtained from the network as well as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. So it is strongly encouraged to use it over md5 for password-based deployments.  
  
Postgres Pro Enterprise database passwords are separate from operating system user passwords. The password for each database user is stored in the pg_authid system catalog. Passwords can be managed with the SQL commands CREATE USER and ALTER ROLE, e.g., CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD 'secret'. If no password has been set up for a user, the stored password is null and password authentication will always fail for that user.

```  
Implement table partitioning.  
  
Table partitioning is like table inheritance and reuses much of the  
existing infrastructure, but there are some important differences.  
The parent is called a partitioned table and is always empty; it may  
not have indexes or non-inherited constraints, since those make no  
sense for a relation with no data of its own.  The children are called  
partitions and contain all of the actual data.  Each partition has an  
implicit partitioning constraint.  Multiple inheritance is not  
allowed, and partitioning and inheritance can't be mixed.  Partitions  
can't have extra columns and may not allow nulls unless the parent  
does.  Tuples inserted into the parent are automatically routed to the  
correct partition, so tuple-routing ON INSERT triggers are not needed.  
Tuple routing isn't yet supported for partitions which are foreign  
tables, and it doesn't handle updates that cross partition boundaries.  
  
Currently, tables can be range-partitioned or list-partitioned.  List  
partitioning is limited to a single column, but range partitioning can  
involve multiple columns.  A partitioning "column" can be an  
expression.  
  
Because table partitioning is less general than table inheritance, it  
is hoped that it will be easier to reason about properties of  
partitions, and therefore that this will serve as a better foundation  
for a variety of possible optimizations, including query planner  
optimizations.  The tuple routing based which this patch does based on  
the implicit partitioning constraints is an example of this, but it  
seems likely that many other useful optimizations are also possible.

Perform one only projection to compute agg arguments.  
  
Previously we did a ExecProject() for each individual aggregate  
argument. That turned out to be a performance bottleneck in queries with  
multiple aggregates.  
  
Doing all the argument computations in one ExecProject() is quite a bit  
cheaper because ExecProject's fastpath can do the work at once in a  
relatively tight loop, and because it can get all the required columns  
with a single slot_getsomeattr and save some other redundant setup  
costs.

## 8. hash index增强

```  
Improve hash index bucket split behavior.  
  
Previously, the right to split a bucket was represented by a  
heavyweight lock on the page number of the primary bucket page.  
Unfortunately, this meant that every scan needed to take a heavyweight  
lock on that bucket also, which was bad for concurrency.  Instead, use  
a cleanup lock on the primary bucket page to indicate the right to  
begin a split, so that scans only need to retain a pin on that page,  
which is they would have to acquire anyway, and which is also much  
cheaper.  
  
In addition to reducing the locking cost, this also avoids locking out  
scans and inserts for the entire lifetime of the split: while the new  
bucket is being populated with copies of the appropriate tuples from  
the old bucket, scans and inserts can happen in parallel.  There are  
minor concurrency improvements for vacuum operations as well, though  
the situation there is still far from ideal.  
  
This patch also removes the unworldly assumption that a split will  
never be interrupted.  With the new code, a split is done in a series  
of small steps and the system can pick up where it left off if it is  
interrupted prior to completion.  While this patch does not itself add  
write-ahead logging for hash indexes, it is clearly a necessary first  
step, since one of the things that could interrupt a split is the  
removal of electrical power from the machine performing it.

```  
Improve handling of dead tuples in hash indexes.  
  
When squeezing a bucket during vacuum, it's not necessary to retain  
any tuples already marked as dead, so ignore them when deciding which  
tuples must be moved in order to empty a bucket page.  Similarly, when  
splitting a bucket, relocating dead tuples to the new bucket is a  
waste of effort; instead, just ignore them.

## 9. 支持进程级条件变量，简化sleep\wakeup设计

```  
Support condition variables.  
  
Condition variables provide a flexible way to sleep until a  
cooperating process causes an arbitrary condition to become true.  In  
simple cases, this can be accomplished with a WaitLatch/ResetLatch  
loop; the cooperating process can call SetLatch after performing work  
that might cause the condition to be satisfied, and the waiting  
process can recheck the condition each time.  However, if the process  
performing the work doesn't have an easy way to identify which  
processes might be waiting, this doesn't work, because it can't  
identify which latches to set.  Condition variables solve that problem  
by internally maintaining a list of waiters; a process that may have  
caused some waiter's condition to be satisfied must "signal" or  
"broadcast" on the condition variable.

```  
postgres_fdw: Push down aggregates to remote servers.  
  
Now that the upper planner uses paths, and now that we have proper hooks  
to inject paths into the upper planning process, it's possible for  
foreign data wrappers to arrange to push aggregates to the remote side  
instead of fetching all of the rows and aggregating them locally.  This  
figures to be a massive win for performance, so teach postgres_fdw to  
do it.

```  
Allow pg_basebackup to stream transaction log in tar mode  
  
This will write the received transaction log into a file called  
pg_wal.tar(.gz) next to the other tarfiles instead of writing it to  
base.tar. When using fetch mode, the transaction log is still written to  
base.tar like before, and when used against a pre-10 server, the file  
is named pg_xlog.tar.  
  
To do this, implement a new concept of a "walmethod", which is  
responsible for writing the WAL. Two implementations exist, one that  
writes to a plain directory (which is also used by pg_receivexlog) and  
one that writes to a tar file with optional compression.
