## 背景         
两阶段提交，在一些客户端异步事务，或者跨库的事务处理中非常常见。  
  
目前，如果数据库crash，PostgreSQL恢复时，对2PC处理机制如下  
  
```  
* on prepare 2pc data (subxacts, commitrels, abortrels, invalmsgs) saved to xlog and to file, but file not is not fsynced  
* on commit backend reads data from file  
* if checkpoint occurs before commit, then files are fsynced during checkpoint  
* if case of crash replay will move data from xlog to files  
```  
  
10.0将改进为  
  
```  
* on prepare backend writes data only to xlog and store pointer to the start of the xlog record  
* if commit occurs before checkpoint then backend reads data from xlog by this pointer  
* on checkpoint 2pc data copied to files and fsynced  
* if commit happens after checkpoint then backend reads files  
* in case of crash replay will move data from xlog to files (as it was before patch)  
```

Hello.  
  
While working with cluster stuff (DTM, tsDTM) we noted that postgres 2pc transactions is approximately two times slower than an ordinary commit on workload with fast transactions — few single-row updates and COMMIT or PREPARE/COMMIT. Perf top showed that a lot of time is spent in kernel on fopen/fclose, so it worth a try to reduce file operations with 2pc tx.  
  
Now 2PC in postgres does following:  
* on prepare 2pc data (subxacts, commitrels, abortrels, invalmsgs) saved to xlog and to file, but file not is not fsynced  
* on commit backend reads data from file  
* if checkpoint occurs before commit, then files are fsynced during checkpoint  
* if case of crash replay will move data from xlog to files  
  
In this patch I’ve changed this procedures to following:  
* on prepare backend writes data only to xlog and store pointer to the start of the xlog record  
* if commit occurs before checkpoint then backend reads data from xlog by this pointer  
* on checkpoint 2pc data copied to files and fsynced  
* if commit happens after checkpoint then backend reads files  
* in case of crash replay will move data from xlog to files (as it was before patch)  
  
Most of that ideas was already mentioned in 2009 thread by Michael Paquier http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/c64c5f8b0908062031k3ff48428j824a9a46f28180ac@mail.gmail.com where he suggested to store 2pc data in shared memory.   
At that time patch was declined because no significant speedup were observed. Now I see performance improvements by my patch at about 60%. Probably old benchmark overall tps was lower and it was harder to hit filesystem fopen/fclose limits.  
  
Now results of benchmark are following (dual 6-core xeon server):  
  
Current master without 2PC: ~42 ktps  
Current master with 2PC: ~22 ktps  
Current master with 2PC: ~36 ktps  
  
Benchmark done with following script:  
  
\set naccounts 100000 * :scale  
\setrandom from_aid 1 :naccounts  
\setrandom to_aid 1 :naccounts  
\setrandom delta 1 100  
\set scale :scale+1  
BEGIN;  
UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = abalance - :delta WHERE aid = :from_aid;  
UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = abalance + :delta WHERE aid = :to_aid;  
PREPARE TRANSACTION ':client_id.:scale';  
COMMIT PREPARED ':client_id.:scale';  
```  
  
这个patch的讨论，详见邮件组，本文末尾URL。  
  
PostgreSQL社区的作风非常严谨，一个patch可能在邮件组中讨论几个月甚至几年，根据大家的意见反复的修正，patch合并到master已经非常成熟，所以PostgreSQL的稳定性也是远近闻名的。
