## 背景     
在添加GUC参数时，需要注意你添加的参数属于什么类别的参数。  
  
例如如果你想让普通用户能随时修改它，那么你需要将参数级别设置为PGC_USERSET。如果你想让超级用户能在线修改它，那么你需要将它设置为PGC_SUSET。如果你想让它能够在修改配置参数并通过信号生效，那么需要设置为PGC_SIGHUP。  
  
GUC参数相关的代码如下  
  
src/backend/utils/misc/guc.c  
  
## 参数级别介绍  
  
```  
/*  
 * Displayable names for context types (enum GucContext)  
 *  
 * Note: these strings are deliberately not localized.  
 */  
const char *const GucContext_Names[] =  
{  
         /* PGC_INTERNAL */ "internal",      编译数据库集群时设置  
         /* PGC_POSTMASTER */ "postmaster",  只能启动是设置  
         /* PGC_SIGHUP */ "sighup",          允许通过修改配置文件，并通过SIGHUP信号更新参数。  
         /* PGC_SU_BACKEND */ "superuser-backend",     超级用户的backend级参数  
         /* PGC_BACKEND */ "backend",                  普通用户的backend级参数  
         /* PGC_SUSET */ "superuser",                  允许超级用户在线修改的参数  
         /* PGC_USERSET */ "user"                      允许普通用户在线修改的参数  
};  
```
