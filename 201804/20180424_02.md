## 背景       
PostgreSQL 10开始支持了分区表的语法，可以通过新的语法创建分区表，而更早的版本则需要使用inherit+check约束+rule/trigger来创建分区表。  
  
[《分区表锁粒度差异 - pg_pathman VS native partition table》](../201802/20180206_01.md)    
  
[《PostgreSQL 传统 hash 分区方法和性能》](../201711/20171122_02.md)    
  
以往，PG通过constraint_exclusion参数来控制select,update,delete的选择。（作用于表、继承、分区表、UNION ALL等，根据设定决定要判断哪些表的check约束）  
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-QUERY-OTHER  
  
分区较多时，constraint_exclusion控制，性能可能较差。  
  
PG 11增加了一个参数 enable_partition_pruning  ，仅用于控制分区表（不用于控制inherit, union all等操作）的QUERY。  
  
也就是说，以后使用创建分区表的语法创建的表，必须通过enable_partition_pruning参数来控制，是否要对select,update,delete操作过滤到目标分区。  
  
```  
Add GUC enable_partition_pruning  
  
This controls both plan-time and execution-time new-style partition  
pruning.  While finer-grain control is possible (maybe using an enum GUC  
instead of boolean), there doesn't seem to be much need for that.  
  
This new parameter controls partition pruning for all queries:  
trivially, SELECT queries that affect partitioned tables are naturally  
under its control since they are using the new technology.  However,  
while UPDATE/DELETE queries do not use the new code, we make the new GUC  
control their behavior also (stealing control from  
constraint_exclusion), because it is more natural, and it leads to a  
more natural transition to the future in which those queries will also  
use the new pruning code.  
  
Constraint exclusion still controls pruning for regular inheritance  
situations (those not involving partitioned tables).
