## 背景   
PostgreSQL recovery时，如何获取需要的wal record呢？  
  
## 流程  
PostgreSQL recovery时，可以从三个地方获取wal record  
  
1、pg_wal 目录  
  
2、recovery.conf中配置的restore_command  
  
3、recovery.conf中配置的stream replication  
  
优先从1开始，如果找不到则返回FALSE，接下来去RESTORE_COMMAND中找，最后是stream。然后再次循环从1开始找。  
  
代码如下  
  
```  
static bool  
  
typedef enum  
{  
        XLOG_FROM_ANY = 0,                      /* request to read WAL from any source */  
        XLOG_FROM_ARCHIVE,                      /* restored using restore_command */  
        XLOG_FROM_PG_WAL,                       /* existing file in pg_wal */  
        XLOG_FROM_STREAM                        /* streamed from master */  
} XLogSource;  
```  
  
src/backend/access/transam/xlog.c  
  
```  
/*  
 * Open the WAL segment containing WAL location 'RecPtr'.  
 *  
 * The segment can be fetched via restore_command, or via walreceiver having  
 * streamed the record, or it can already be present in pg_wal. Checking  
 * pg_wal is mainly for crash recovery, but it will be polled in standby mode  
 * too, in case someone copies a new segment directly to pg_wal. That is not  
 * documented or recommended, though.  
 *  
 * If 'fetching_ckpt' is true, we're fetching a checkpoint record, and should  
 * prepare to read WAL starting from RedoStartLSN after this.  
 *  
 * 'RecPtr' might not point to the beginning of the record we're interested  
 * in, it might also point to the page or segment header. In that case,  
 * 'tliRecPtr' is the position of the WAL record we're interested in. It is  
 * used to decide which timeline to stream the requested WAL from.  
 *  
 * If the record is not immediately available, the function returns false  
 * if we're not in standby mode. In standby mode, waits for it to become  
 * available.  
 *  
 * When the requested record becomes available, the function opens the file  
 * containing it (if not open already), and returns true. When end of standby  
 * mode is triggered by the user, and there is no more WAL available, returns  
 * false.

recovery.conf  
  
```  
#restore_command = ''           # e.g. 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f %p'  
  
#primary_conninfo = ''          # e.g. 'host=localhost port=5432'
