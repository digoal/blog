pg_top is 'top' for PostgreSQL. It is derived from Unix Top. Similar to top,  
pg_top allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes. It also allows you to:  
  
    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.  
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.  
    * View locks held by a process.  
    * View user table statistics.  
    * View user index statistics.  
  
CAVEAT: version 3 of pg_top has internal commands that kill and renice  
processes.  Although I have taken steps to insure that pg_top makes  
appropriate checks with these commands, I cannot guarantee that these  
internal commands are totally secure.  IF YOU INSTALL pg_top SET-USER-ID  
TO ROOT, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK!  I realize that some operating  
systems will require pg_top to run setuid root, and I will do everything  
I can to make sure that pg_top is a secure setuid program.  
  
To compile and install "pg_top", read the file "INSTALL" and follow the  
directions and advice contained therein.  
  
If you make any kind of change to "pg_top" that you feel would be  
beneficial to others who use this program, or if you find and fix a bug,  
please send the change to the pg_top mailing list.  
  
In order to monitor a remote database, the pg_proctab extension needs to be  
created on the database to be monitored.  Any operating system that pg_proctab  
supports can be monitored remotely on any operating system.  See details for  
pg_protab here:  
  
http://pgxn.org/dist/pg_proctab/  
  
Be sure to read the FAQ enclosed with the distrubution.  It contains  
answers to the most commonly asked questions about the configuration,  
installation, and operation of pg_top.
