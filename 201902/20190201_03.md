## 背景              
在执行vacuum时，有一个cleanup阶段，以往，不管这个阶段是否需要清理PAGE，只要表上面有索引，就需要对这个表的索引全部扫描一遍。    
    
今天，PG 11版本，增加了一个GUC参数vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor，以及btree索引参数vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor。在btree index meta page上存储了当前表有多少条记录（仅仅当vacuum时发现整个表没有dead tuples（取自pg_stat_all_tables这种统计计数器）时更新meta page），当    
    
1、((表上的 pg_stat_all_tables insert 计数器 - meta page)/meta page) 大于 vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor 时，vacuum cleanup阶段才需要SCAN INDEX，更新INDEX stats信息(包括meta page计数器信息)。    
    
或    
    
2、有deleted pages that can be recycled during cleanup需要清理时，必定要scan index pages.     
    
因此，对于大量INSERT，没有UPDATE,DELETE操作的表的VACUUM，或者常规静态表的VACUUM会快很多，因为不需要SCAN INDEX了。    
    
    
## 背景技术    
vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor (floating point)    
    
```    
Specifies the fraction of the total number of heap tuples counted in the previous statistics collection     
that can be inserted     
without incurring an index scan at the VACUUM cleanup stage.     
This setting currently applies to B-tree indexes only.    
    
If no tuples were deleted from the heap,     
B-tree indexes are still scanned at the VACUUM cleanup stage     
when at least one of the following conditions is met:     
1、the index statistics are stale,     
2、or the index contains deleted pages that can be recycled during cleanup.     
Index statistics are considered to be stale if     
the number of newly inserted tuples     
exceeds the vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor fraction of the total number of heap tuples detected by the previous statistics collection.     
    
The total number of heap tuples is stored in the index meta-page.     
Note that the meta-page does not include this data until VACUUM finds no dead tuples,     
so B-tree index scan at the cleanup stage can only be skipped     
if the second and subsequent VACUUM cycles detect no dead tuples.  (典型的insert only场景，或者vacuum干掉所有dead tuple后)    
    
    
The value can range from 0 to 10000000000.     
When vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor is set to 0,     
index scans are never skipped during VACUUM cleanup.     
The default value is 0.1.    
```    
    
B-tree indexes additionally accept this parameter:    
    
vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor    
    
Per-index value for vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor.

## 例子    
    
    
tbl1，每次vacuum都要scan index    
    
```    
create table tbl1 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, c5 int, c6 int);    
create index idx_tbl1_1 on tbl1 (c1) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
create index idx_tbl1_2 on tbl1 (c2) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
create index idx_tbl1_3 on tbl1 (c3) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
create index idx_tbl1_4 on tbl1 (c4) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
create index idx_tbl1_5 on tbl1 (c5) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
create index idx_tbl1_6 on tbl1 (c6) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=0);    
```    
    
tbl2，当有deleted page需要recycle使用时，或者当((pg_stat_all_tables.inserted-metapage(上一次vacuum有多少条记录))/上一次vacuum有多少条记录) > 100000000 时，才需要scan index。    
    
```    
create table tbl2 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, c5 int, c6 int);    
create index idx_tbl2_1 on tbl2 (c1) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
create index idx_tbl2_2 on tbl2 (c2) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
create index idx_tbl2_3 on tbl2 (c3) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
create index idx_tbl2_4 on tbl2 (c4) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
create index idx_tbl2_5 on tbl2 (c5) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
create index idx_tbl2_6 on tbl2 (c6) with (vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000);    
```    
    
分别写入1000万记录    
    
```    
insert into tbl1 select id,id,id,id,id,id from generate_series(1,10000000) t(id);    
insert into tbl2 select id,id,id,id,id,id from generate_series(1,10000000) t(id);    
```

### 分析    
tbl1，由于每次vacuum都需要scan index，所以更加耗时。    
    
tbl2，由于设置了vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor=100000000，下一次vacuum时insert减去上一次的总记录数再除以上一次总记录数，小于100000000，所以不需要scan index。    
    
耗时来看，相当明显。     
  
通过pageinspect，可以观察到btree索引metapage上的table tuples总数。  
  
```  
postgres=# create extension pageinspect;  
CREATE EXTENSION  
  
postgres=# select * from bt_metap('idx_tbl1_1');  
 magic  | version | root | level | fastroot | fastlevel | oldest_xact | last_cleanup_num_tuples   
--------+---------+------+-------+----------+-----------+-------------+-------------------------  
 340322 |       3 |  412 |     2 |      412 |         2 |           0 |             9.99977e+06
