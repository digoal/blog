数据库为了得到一条SQL的最优执行计划，通常需要通过优化器来解决。  
  
PostgreSQL 支持很多种优化器，例如cbo, geqo， aqo等。  
  
[《数据库优化器原理(含动态规划、机器学习建模优化器aqo) - 如何治疗选择综合症》](../201705/20170507_01.md)    
  
以CBO为例，基于成本的优化。成本计算的好与坏直接决定了执行计划的好坏。成本计算相关因素：公式本身，因子，以及统计信息的准确性。  
  
统计信息又包括：相关性，唯一值个数，高频值，高频值比例，柱状图等等。  
  
```  
postgres=# \d pg_stats  
                     View "pg_catalog.pg_stats"  
         Column         |   Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default

```  
  
默认情况下PG只统计每一列的统计信息，对于复杂条件（多个字段的AND OR或者包括字段、表达式的AND OR组合条件，根据统计信息得到的选择性的评估可能不准确，导致SQL优化得到的执行计划不准确），为了提高复杂条件的SQL优化准确性，PG 10开始支持自定义统计信息。  
  
[《PostgreSQL 10 黑科技 - 自定义统计信息》](../201709/20170902_02.md)    
  
用户可以根据SQL的条件，自己定义与条件相符的多列组合统计信息。  
  
PG 10的版本支持的较为简陋，自定义统计信息仅包括多少个唯一值、相关性。  
  
PG 12，将支持多字段组合高频词统计等内容，提高评估准确性。  
  
```
Add support for multivariate MCV lists   
  
Introduce a third extended statistic type, supported by the CREATE  
STATISTICS command - MCV lists, a generalization of the statistic  
already built and used for individual columns.  
  
Compared to the already supported types (n-distinct coefficients and  
functional dependencies), MCV lists are more complex, include column  
values and allow estimation of much wider range of common clauses  
(equality and inequality conditions, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL etc.).  
Similarly to the other types, a new pseudo-type (pg_mcv_list) is used.
