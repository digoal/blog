## 背景     
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=af6550d34466b3093edda54a0cc5a6f220d321b7  
  
```  
Sort dependent objects before reporting them in DROP ROLE.  
  
Commit 8aa9dd74b didn't quite finish the job in this area after all,  
because DROP ROLE has a code path distinct from DROP OWNED BY, and  
it was still reporting dependent objects in whatever order the index  
scan returned them in.  
  
Buildfarm experience shows that index ordering of equal-keyed objects is  
significantly less stable than before in the wake of using heap TIDs as  
tie-breakers.  So if we try to hide the unstable ordering by suppressing  
DETAIL reports, we're just going to end up having to do that for every  
DROP that reports multiple objects.  That's not great from a coverage  
or problem-detection standpoint, and it's something we'll inevitably  
forget in future patches, leading to more iterations of fixing-an-  
unstable-result.  So let's just bite the bullet and sort here too.
