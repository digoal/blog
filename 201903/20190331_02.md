## 背景       
[《PostgreSQL DaaS设计注意 - schema与database的抉择》](../201610/20161012_01.md)    
  
当使用standby时，主节点DROP 对象，除了删除文件，还需要搜索shared buffer，清理shared buffer中残留的对象buffer。  
  
当主节点有物理流复制的从节点存在时，主节点DROP DATABASE， drop object, drop schema时，从节点回放redo时也需要做同样的事情（除了删除文件，还需要搜索shared buffer，清理shared buffer中残留的对象buffer）。  
  
主节点清理shared buffer有做过优化，在一个事务中删除多个对象时，调用smgrdounlinkall，清理shared buffer中残留的对象buffer只需要扫描一次buffer。  
  
而在standby中，drop 对象回放的动作调用的是smgrdounlink，需要多次扫描shared buffer(每个被删除的对象一次）。  
  
优化PATCH：在standby中的做法与主节点一致：一个事务中删除多个对象时，调用smgrdounlinkall，清理shared buffer中残留的对象buffer只需要扫描一次buffer。  
  
  
```  
Improve the performance of relation deletes during recovery.  
  
When multiple relations are deleted at the same transaction,  
the files of those relations are deleted by one call to smgrdounlinkall(),  
which leads to scan whole shared_buffers only one time. OTOH,  
previously, during recovery, smgrdounlink() (not smgrdounlinkall()) was  
called for each file to delete, which led to scan shared_buffers  
multiple times. Obviously this could cause to increase the WAL replay  
time very much especially when shared_buffers was huge.  
  
To alleviate this situation, this commit changes the recovery so that  
it also calls smgrdounlinkall() only one time to delete multiple  
relation files.  
  
This is just fix for oversight of commit 279628a0a7, not new feature.  
So, per discussion on pgsql-hackers, we concluded to backpatch this  
to all supported versions.

Track unowned relations in doubly-linked list  
  
Relations dropped in a single transaction are tracked in a list of  
unowned relations.  With large number of dropped relations this resulted  
in poor performance at the end of a transaction, when the relations are  
removed from the singly linked list one by one.  
  
Commit b4166911 attempted to address this issue (particularly when it  
happens during recovery) by removing the relations in a reverse order,  
resulting in O(1) lookups in the list of unowned relations.  This did  
not work reliably, though, and it was possible to trigger the O(N^2)  
behavior in various ways.  
  
Instead of trying to remove the relations in a specific order with  
respect to the linked list, which seems rather fragile, switch to a  
regular doubly linked.  That allows us to remove relations cheaply no  
matter where in the list they are.  
  
As b4166911 was a bugfix, backpatched to all supported versions, do the  
same thing here.
