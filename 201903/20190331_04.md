## 背景           
PostgreSQL 12 新增integerset数据结构，高效64-bit ints存储 - 内部使用b-tree存储（底层使用算法 Simple-8b，对于btree leaf page的内容压缩效率较高）。    
    
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=df816f6ad532ad685a3897869a2e64d3a53fe312    
    
```    
Add IntegerSet, to hold large sets of 64-bit ints efficiently.    
    
The set is implemented as a B-tree, with a compact representation at leaf    
items, using Simple-8b algorithm, so that clusters of nearby values use    
less memory.    
    
The IntegerSet isn't used for anything yet, aside from the test code, but    
we have two patches in the works that would benefit from this: A patch to    
allow GiST vacuum to delete empty pages, and a patch to reduce heap    
VACUUM's memory usage, by storing the list of dead TIDs more efficiently    
and lifting the 1 GB limit on its size.    
    
This includes a unit test module, in src/test/modules/test_integerset.    
It can be used to verify correctness, as a regression test, but if you run    
it manully, it can also print memory usage and execution time of some of    
the tests.

integerset数据结构介绍，例如：    
    
1、用于在vacuum 时用来存储dead tuple，dead tuple为64bit int，节约autovacuum_work_mem空间。

2、用于gist page vacuum

```    
   6  * IntegerSet provides an in-memory data structure to hold a set of    
   7  * arbitrary 64-bit integers.  Internally, the values are stored in a    
   8  * B-tree, with a special packed representation at the leaf level using    
   9  * the Simple-8b algorithm, which can pack hold clusters of nearby values    
  10  * very tightly.    
```

   6  * IntegerSet provides an in-memory data structure to hold a set of    
   7  * arbitrary 64-bit integers.  Internally, the values are stored in a    
   8  * B-tree, with a special packed representation at the leaf level using

  10  * very tightly.    
  11  *    
  12  * Memory consumption depends on the number of values stored, but also    
  13  * on how far the values are from each other.  In the best case, with    
  14  * long runs of consecutive integers, memory consumption can be as low as    
  15  * 0.1 bytes per integer.  In the worst case, if integers are more than    
  16  * 2^32 apart, it uses about 8 bytes per integer.  In typical use, the    
  17  * consumption per integer is somewhere between those extremes, depending    
  18  * on the range of integers stored, and how "clustered" they are.    
  19  *    
  20  *    
  21  * Interface    
  22  * ---------    
  23  *    
  24  *  intset_create           - Create a new empty set.    
  25  *  intset_add_member       - Add an integer to the set.    
  26  *  intset_is_member        - Test if an integer is in the set    
  27  *  intset_begin_iterate    - Begin iterating through all integers in set    
  28  *  intset_iterate_next     - Return next integer    
  29  *    
  30  * intset_create() creates the set in the current memory context.  Note    
  31  * that there is no function to free an integer set.  If you need to do that,    
  32  * create a dedicated memory context to hold it, and destroy the memory    
  33  * context instead.    
  34  *    
  35  *    
  36  * Limitations    
  37  * -----------    
  38  *    
  39  * - Values must be added in order.  (Random insertions would require    
  40  *   splitting nodes, which hasn't been implemented.)    
  41  *    
  42  * - Values cannot be added while iteration is in progress.    
  43  *    
  44  * - No support for removing values.    
  45  *    
  46  * None of these limitations are fundamental to the data structure, and    
  47  * could be lifted if needed, by writing some new code.  But the current    
  48  * users of this facility don't need them.
