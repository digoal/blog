## 背景   
分区表order by 分区字段时，如果分区是有序的，那么不需要使用merge append （merge sort），避免merge SORT的额外开销。    
  
```  
Use Append rather than MergeAppend for scanning ordered partitions.

Use Append rather than MergeAppend for scanning ordered partitions.  
  
If we need ordered output from a scan of a partitioned table, but  
the ordering matches the partition ordering, then we don't need to  
use a MergeAppend to combine the pre-ordered per-partition scan  
results: a plain Append will produce the same results.  This  
both saves useless comparison work inside the MergeAppend proper,  
and allows us to start returning tuples after istarting up just  
the first child node not all of them.  
  
However, all is not peaches and cream, because if some of the  
child nodes have high startup costs then there will be big  
discontinuities in the tuples-returned-versus-elapsed-time curve.  
The planner's cost model cannot handle that (yet, anyway).  
If we model the Append's startup cost as being just the first  
child's startup cost, we may drastically underestimate the cost  
of fetching slightly more tuples than are available from the first  
child.  Since we've had bad experiences with over-optimistic choices  
of "fast start" plans for ORDER BY LIMIT queries, that seems scary.  
As a klugy workaround, set the startup cost estimate for an ordered  
Append to be the sum of its children's startup costs (as MergeAppend  
would).  This doesn't really describe reality, but it's less likely  
to cause a bad plan choice than an underestimated startup cost would.  
In practice, the cases where we really care about this optimization  
will have child plans that are IndexScans with zero startup cost,  
so that the overly conservative estimate is still just zero.

## 例子  
  
```  
CREATE TABLE cities_ab (  
    id int primary key,  
    info        text,  
    crt_time       timestamp  
) PARTITION BY RANGE (id);  
  
CREATE TABLE cities_ab_1  
    PARTITION OF cities_ab FOR VALUES FROM (1) TO (100000);  
  
CREATE TABLE cities_ab_2  
    PARTITION OF cities_ab FOR VALUES FROM (100000) TO (200000);  
  
insert into cities_ab select generate_series(1,199999),md5(random()::text), now();  
  
  
postgres=# explain select * from cities_ab order by id limit 10;  
                                               QUERY PLAN                                                  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Limit  (cost=0.58..1.10 rows=10 width=45)  
   ->  Append  (cost=0.58..10268.57 rows=199999 width=45)  
         ->  Index Scan using cities_ab_1_pkey on cities_ab_1  (cost=0.29..4634.28 rows=99999 width=45)  
         ->  Index Scan using cities_ab_2_pkey on cities_ab_2  (cost=0.29..4634.29 rows=100000 width=45)  
(4 rows)  
```  
  
PostgreSQL 11，使用了merge append。  
  
```  
postgres=# explain select * from cities_ab order by id limit 10;  
                                               QUERY PLAN                                                  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Limit  (cost=0.59..0.97 rows=10 width=44)  
   ->  Merge Append  (cost=0.59..7947.55 rows=211310 width=44)  
         Sort Key: cities_ab_1.id  
         ->  Index Scan using cities_ab_1_pkey on cities_ab_1  (cost=0.29..2917.22 rows=105655 width=44)  
         ->  Index Scan using cities_ab_2_pkey on cities_ab_2  (cost=0.29..2917.22 rows=105655 width=44)  
(5 rows)  
```
