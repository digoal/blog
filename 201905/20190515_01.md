## 背景      
PostgreSQL 自定义函数给数据库优化器能传达的信息包括单次调用的成本，返回的行数。  
  
cost, rows都是常量，然而实际情况是：每次UDF的调用花费的成本和返回的行数可能无法固定。  
  
PostgreSQL 12支持了新功能，允许自定义UDF的SUPPORT函数(优化器使用它)，用于动态评估UDF的COST、ROWS，选择性等。  
  
  
```  
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] FUNCTION  
    name ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [ { DEFAULT | = } default_expr ] [, ...] ] )  
    [ RETURNS rettype  
      | RETURNS TABLE ( column_name column_type [, ...] ) ]  
  { LANGUAGE lang_name  
    | TRANSFORM { FOR TYPE type_name } [, ... ]  
    | WINDOW  
    | IMMUTABLE | STABLE | VOLATILE | [ NOT ] LEAKPROOF  
    | CALLED ON NULL INPUT | RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT | STRICT  
    | [ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY INVOKER | [ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY DEFINER  
    | PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }  
    | COST execution_cost  
    | ROWS result_rows  
    | SUPPORT support_function  
    | SET configuration_parameter { TO value | = value | FROM CURRENT }  
    | AS 'definition'  
    | AS 'obj_file', 'link_symbol'  
  } ...  
```  
  
support函数必须为C写的。  
  
```

    | ROWS result_rows  
    | SUPPORT support_function  
```  
  
  
SUPPORT support_function  
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a planner support function to use for this function. See Section 37.11 for details. You must be superuser to use this option.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 *  
 * supportnodes.h  
 *        Definitions for planner support functions.  
 *  
 * This file defines the API for "planner support functions", which  
 * are SQL functions (normally written in C) that can be attached to  
 * another "target" function to give the system additional knowledge  
 * about the target function.  All the current capabilities have to do  
 * with planning queries that use the target function, though it is  
 * possible that future extensions will add functionality to be invoked  
 * by the parser or executor.  
 *  
 * A support function must have the SQL signature  
 *              supportfn(internal) returns internal  
 * The argument is a pointer to one of the Node types defined in this file.  
 * The result is usually also a Node pointer, though its type depends on  
 * which capability is being invoked.  In all cases, a NULL pointer result  
 * (that's PG_RETURN_POINTER(NULL), not PG_RETURN_NULL()) indicates that  
 * the support function cannot do anything useful for the given request.  
 * Support functions must return a NULL pointer, not fail, if they do not  
 * recognize the request node type or cannot handle the given case; this  
 * allows for future extensions of the set of request cases.

 * The Simplify request allows the support function to perform plan-time

 * length coercion that does not decrease the allowed length of its argument  
 * could be replaced by a RelabelType node, or "x + 0" could be replaced by  
 * "x".  This is invoked during the planner's constant-folding pass, so the  
 * function's arguments can be presumed already simplified.  
 *  
 * The planner's PlannerInfo "root" is typically not needed, but can be  
 * consulted if it's necessary to obtain info about Vars present in  
 * the given node tree.  Beware that root could be NULL in some usages.

 * The IndexCondition request allows the support function to generate  
 * a directly-indexable condition based on a target function call that is  
 * not itself indexable.  The target function call must appear at the top  
 * level of WHERE or JOIN/ON, so this applies only to functions returning  
 * boolean.  
 *  
 * The "node" argument is the parse node that is invoking the target function;  
 * currently this will always be a FuncExpr or OpExpr.  The call is made  
 * only if at least one function argument matches an index column's variable  
 * or expression.  "indexarg" identifies the matching argument (it's the  
 * argument's zero-based index in the node's args list).  
 *  
 * If the transformation is possible, return a List of directly-indexable  
 * condition expressions, else return NULL.  (A List is used because it's  
 * sometimes useful to generate more than one indexable condition, such as  
 * when a LIKE with constant prefix gives rise to both >= and < conditions.)  
 *  
 * "Directly indexable" means that the condition must be directly executable  
 * by the index machinery.  Typically this means that it is a binary OpExpr  
 * with the index column value on the left, a pseudo-constant on the right,  
 * and an operator that is in the index column's operator family.  Other  
 * possibilities include RowCompareExpr, ScalarArrayOpExpr, and NullTest,  
 * depending on the index type; but those seem less likely to be useful for  
 * derived index conditions.  "Pseudo-constant" means that the right-hand  
 * expression must not contain any volatile functions, nor any Vars of the  
 * table the index is for; use is_pseudo_constant_for_index() to check this.  
 * (Note: if the passed "node" is an OpExpr, the core planner already verified  
 * that the non-indexkey operand is pseudo-constant; but when the "node"  
 * is a FuncExpr, it does not check, since it doesn't know which of the  
 * function's arguments you might need to use in an index comparison value.)  
 *  
 * In many cases, an index condition can be generated but it is weaker than  
 * the function condition itself; for example, a LIKE with a constant prefix  
 * can produce an index range check based on the prefix, but we still need  
 * to execute the LIKE operator to verify the rest of the pattern.  We say  
 * that such an index condition is "lossy".  When returning an index condition,  
 * you should set the "lossy" request field to true if the condition is lossy,  
 * or false if it is an exact equivalent of the function's result.  The core  
 * code will initialize that field to true, which is the common case.  
 *  
 * It is important to verify that the index operator family is the correct  
 * one for the condition you want to generate.  Core support functions tend  
 * to use the known OID of a built-in opfamily for this, but extensions need  
 * to work harder, since their OIDs aren't fixed.  A possibly workable  
 * answer for an index on an extension datatype is to verify the index AM's  
 * OID instead, and then assume that there's only one relevant opclass for  
 * your datatype so the opfamily must be the right one.  Generating OpExpr  
 * nodes may also require knowing extension datatype OIDs (often you can  
 * find these out by applying exprType() to a function argument) and  
 * operator OIDs (which you can look up using get_opfamily_member).
