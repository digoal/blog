## 背景     
PostgreSQL 活跃会话表pg_stat_activity 表示数据库会话的当前状态，其中有表示会话当前正在等待的事件的信息，但是只有当前状态，实际上，我们可能还需要更多信息来分析数据库的性能问题：  
  
1、某个事务，有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
2、某条sql，在一次特定的请求种：有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
3、某条sql，在一个统计周期内请求了多少次，一共：有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
4、某个会话，在一个统计周期内请求了多少次，一共：有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
5、某个DB，在一个统计周期内请求了多少次，一共：有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
6、用户，在一个统计周期内请求了多少次，一共：有多少种等待事件，每个等待事件分别等了多少次，每个等待事件分别等了多久。  
  
如果有以上统计信息，可以更加精准的了解数据库的瓶颈在哪？  
  
要完成以上统计，必须记录每次等待的耗时，次数。目前并没有这个信息。

目前有什么？  
  
1、pg_wait_sampling插件，记录等待事件的次数，但是不记录等待时间。  
  
[《PostgreSQL 等待事件 及 等待采样统计(pg_wait_sampling)》](../201610/20161006_01.md)    
  
powa有用到这个插件来展示等待事件维度的统计数据。  
  
[《powa4 PostreSQL Workload Analyzer - PostgreSQL监控工具、带WEB展示 - 索引推荐,等待事件分析,命中率,配置变更跟踪等》](../201905/20190520_01.md)    
  
2、除此以外，aws, alibaba在产品中也提供了等待事件的快照（定期采集pg_stat_activity）的信息，同样，只有等待事件的次数，没有耗时。  
  
[《PostgreSQL Oracle 兼容性之 - performance insight - AWS performance insight 理念与实现解读 - 珍藏级》](../201901/20190125_02.md)    
  
PG 13可能引入等待事件的统计（包括次数、耗时），类似oracle ash  
  
```

```  
  
但是同时行业可能引入一个问题，性能损耗，因为gettimeofday引入的问题。  
  
因此可能会以插件形式存在，用户可以自由开关统计。

It probably is there because the OP realizes that most people wouldn't  
accept having this code compiled in.

On machines with slow gettimeofday(), I suspect the cost of this  
patch would be staggering.  Even with relatively fast gettimeofday,  
it doesn't look acceptable for calls in hot code paths (for instance,  
lwlock.c).  
    
A bigger problem is that it breaks stuff.  There are countless  
calls to pgstat_report_wait_start/pgstat_report_wait_end that  
assume they have no side-effects (for example, on errno) and  
can never fail.  I wouldn't trust GetCurrentTimestamp() for either.  
If the report_wait calls can't be dropped into code with *complete*  
certainty that they're safe, that's a big cost.  
    
Why exactly is this insisting on logging timestamps and not,  
say, just incrementing a counter?  I think doing it like this  
is almost certain to end in rejection.

于此相关的行为包括：auto_explain 插件开启后，也会引入gettimeofday。凡有时间相关的可能都有类似问题，例如 log_duration, log_min_duration_statement, pg_stat_statements 等。  
  
[《PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements 开启后引入slock导致高并发下的性能问题》](../201912/20191230_02.md)    
  
在这个patch的讨论中也提到了一个想法，采样统计，不统计每次等待，想法类似

## patch 原型  
  
```  
Hello hackers,  
    
  This proposal is about recording additional statisticsofwait events.  
    
  PostgreSQL statistics Issue  
   
  ----------------------------------------  
    
  The pg_stat_activity view is very useful in analysis for performance issues.  
  But it is difficult to get information of wait events in detail,  
  when you need to deep dive into analysis of performance.  
  It is because pg_stat_activity just shows the current wait status of backend.  
  If PostgreSQL provides additional statistics about wait events,  
  it will be helpful in pinpointing the exact cause of throughput issue.  
  
  Proposal  
  ----------------------------------------  
  Record additional statistics items per wait event for every backend.  
  
  - total elapsed time to wait  
  - max elapsed time to wait  
  - number of times being waited  
  
  I suggest storing the above statistics in the pgBackendStatus structure.  
  
  typedef struct PgBackendStatus  
  {  
  ...  
  /*  
  * proc's wait_event additional information.  
  * each wait_events elapsed time  count.  
  */  
  
  TimestampTz st_wait_event_start_timestamp;  
  uint64 st_wait_event_total_elapsed[NUM_WAIT_EVENT];  
  uint64 st_wait_event_max_elapsed[NUM_WAIT_EVENT];  
  uint32 st_wait_event_counting[NUM_WAIT_EVENT];  
  }  
  
  
  PoC test  
  ----------------------------------------  
  
  I wrote a prototype patch.  
  
  With this patch, you can get additional wait event stats via  
  
  the new procedure ‘pg_stat_get_wait_events()’.  
  You can test by following steps.  
  
  1. apply git patch  
  - patch -p0  wait_event_stat_patchfile.diff  
  2. make distclean  
  3. configure --with-wait-event-detail  
  4. make  make install  
  5. start postgreSQL and execute psql  
  6. using pg_stat_get_wait_events(null) function  
  
  - input parameter is pid.  
  
  display example  
  
  postgres=# select * from pg_stat_get_wait_events(null) where counting 0;  
  pid | wait_event_type | wait_event | total_elapsed | max_elapsed | counting

  24251| IO | WALWrite |17935|961|2720  
  (18rows)  
  
  etc. concept proposal  
  ------------------------------------------  
  
  1. I allocated arrays for additional statistics per wait event.  
   Normally the backend doesn’t use all wait events.  
   So the size of memory used for recording statistics can be reduced  
  by allocating one hash list as memory pool for statistics of wait events.  
  
  2. This feature can be implemented as extension  
  if some hooks were provided in following functions,  
  - pgstat_report_wait_start  
  - Pgstat_report_wait_end  
  Feedback and suggestion will be very welcome.  
  Thanks!

## 精彩讨论  
```  
Hi all,  
    
I think sampling like Oracle ASH should work for the DBA to find probable bottlenecks in many cases (, so I hope PostgreSQL will incorporate it...)  On the other hand, it seems to have the following disadvantages, some of which others have already pointed out:  
    
1. Doesn't provide precise data  
Sampling could miss intermittent short waits, e.g., buffer content lock waits during checkpoints.  This might make it difficult or impossible to solve transient performance problems, such as infrequent 100 millisecond response times while the normal response time is a few milliseconds.  
The proposed wait event collection doesn't miss anything.  
    
2. Overuses resources  
We may be able to shorten the sampling interval to 10 ms or even 1 ms to detect short periods of problems.  However, the sampled data of active sessions become voluminous in memory and storage.  It would take longer to analyze those samples.  Also, the background sampling process prevents the CPU core from becoming idle to save power, which bgwriter and walwriter tries to avoid by hibernation.  
The proposed wait event collection just records what actually happened.  No waste.  Would it use many resources if waits happen frequently?  That leads to our motivation to reduce waits.  
    
3. Cannot determine the impact or illness of waits just by sampling or counting without time  
As the following MySQL and Oracle manual articles describe, precise measurement of wait count and time helps to judge the impact and justify the remedy.  They can measure the whole SQL execution and its various processing steps (parse, plan, sort, etc.) as well as waits, so that the most significant areas can be determined.  
Also, sampling cannot tell if a single wait took long or the same waits occurred repeatedly in succession (at least easily.)  Do the sampled waits indicate an abnormal I/O (which took 2 ms while the normal time is 50 us)?

Chapter 26 MySQL Performance Schema  
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema.html  
--------------------------------------------------  
The Performance Schema monitors server events. An “event” is anything the server does that takes time and has been instrumented so that timing information can be collected. In general, an event could be a function call, a wait for the operating system, a stage of an SQL statement execution such as parsing or sorting, or an entire statement or group of statements. Event collection provides access to information about synchronization calls (such as for mutexes) file and table I/O, table locks, and so forth for the server and for several storage engines.  
    
Current events are available, as well as event histories and summaries. This enables you to determine how many times instrumented activities were performed and how much time they took. Event information is available to show the activities of specific threads, or activity associated with particular objects such as a mutex or file.

--------------------------------------------------  
The goal of database performance tuning is to reduce the DB time of the system for a given workload. By reducing DB time, the database can support more user requests by using the same or fewer resources. ADDM reports system resources that are using a significant portion of DB time as problem areas and sorts them in descending order by the amount of related DB time spent.

Instance Tuning Using Performance Views  
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/tgdba/instance-tuning-using-performance-views.html#GUID-07982549-507F-4465-8843-7F753BCF8F99  
--------------------------------------------------  
Wait event statistics include the number of times an event was waited for and the time waited for the event to complete. If the initialization parameter TIMED_STATISTICS is set to true, then you can also see how long each resource was waited for.  
To minimize user response time, reduce the time spent by server processes waiting for event completion. Not all wait events have the same wait time. Therefore, it is more important to examine events with the most total time waited rather than wait events with a high number of occurrences. Usually, it is best to set the dynamic parameter TIMED_STATISTICS to true at least while monitoring performance.  
--------------------------------------------------  
    
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/tgdba/measuring-database-performance.html#GUID-811E9E65-C64A-4028-A90E-102BBFF6E68F  
5.2.3 Using Wait Events without Timed Statistics  
--------------------------------------------------  
If TIMED_STATISTICS is set to FALSE, then the amount of time spent waiting for an event is not available. Therefore, it is only possible to order wait events by the number of times each event was waited for. Although the events with the largest number of waits might indicate a potential bottleneck, they might not be the main bottleneck. This situation can happen when an event is waited for a large number of times, but the total time waited for that event is small. Conversely, an event with fewer waits might be a bigger bottleneck if the wait time accounts for a significant proportion of the total wait time. Without the wait times to use for comparison, it is difficult to determine whether a wait event is worth investigating.  
--------------------------------------------------  
    
10.2.2 Using Wait Event Statistics to Drill Down to Bottlenecks  
--------------------------------------------------  
The most effective way to use wait event data is to order the events by the wait time. This is only possible if TIMED_STATISTICS is set to true. Otherwise, the wait events can only be ranked by the number of times waited, which is often not the ordering that best represents the problem.  
    
To get an indication of where time is spent, follow these steps:  
    
1. Examine the data collection for V$SYSTEM_EVENT. The events of interest should be ranked by wait time.  
Identify the wait events that have the most significant percentage of wait time. ...  
Alternatively, look at the Top 5 Timed Events section at the beginning of the Automatic Workload Repository report. This section automatically orders the wait events (omitting idle events), and calculates the relative percentage:  
    
Top 5 Timed Events  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                % Total  
Event                                         Waits    Time (s) Call Time  
-------------------------------------- ------------ ----------- ---------  
CPU time                                                    559     88.80  
log file parallel write                       2,181          28      4.42  
SQL*Net more data from client               516,611          27      4.24  
db file parallel write                       13,383          13      2.04  
db file sequential read                         563           2       .27  
    
2. Look at the number of waits for these events, and the average wait time. For example, for I/O related events, the average time might help identify whether the I/O system is slow. The following example of this data is taken from the Wait Event section of the AWR report:  
    
                                                             Avg  
                                                Total Wait   wait     Waits  
Event                           Waits  Timeouts   Time (s)   (ms)      /txn  
--------------------------- --------- --------- ---------- ------ ---------  
log file parallel write         2,181         0         28     13      41.2  
SQL*Net more data from clie   516,611         0         27      0   9,747.4  
db file parallel write         13,383         0         13      1     252.5  
    
3. The top wait events identify the next places to investigate. A table of common wait events is listed in Table 10-1. It is usually a good idea to also have quick look at high-load SQL.  
   
4. Examine the related data indicated by the wait events to see what other information this data provides. Determine whether this information is consistent with the wait event data. In most situations, there is enough data to begin developing a theory about the potential causes of the performance bottleneck.  
   
5. To determine whether this theory is valid, cross-check data you have examined with other statistics available for consistency. The appropriate statistics vary depending on the problem, but usually include load profile-related data in V$SYSSTAT, operating system statistics, and so on. Perform cross-checks with other data to confirm or refute the developing theory.  
--------------------------------------------------  
    
So, why don't we have the proposed wait event count/time data?  I hope we can nurture this to become a database profiling tool like MySQL and Oracle.  This is the first step.  I think it would be useful to have both sampling and precise statistics.  Oracle has both, and MySQL has the latter (I don't know why MySQL doesn't provide sampling, because the Performance Schema should probably have been developed after Oracle's ASH.)  
    
What would make us conservative about doing this?  Skimming the old thread, the remaining concern is the timer overhead.  As the following article suggests, some lightweight timers seem to be available.  We can turn the timing off by default if they aren't light enough.
