## 背景     
PostgreSQL 10开始内置了逻辑订阅的功能，两个PG数据库之间可用相互共享（订阅）数据（表级别）。  
  
但是老的版本没有支持filter功能，即无法到行级别订阅功能（当然也无法支持列级别），PG 13 将支持row filter，通过row filter，在上有的数据只有复合条件的记录才会被订阅到下游数据库。  
  
## 原型讨论  
创建publication或往publication中添加被订阅到表时，可以指定filter （where）。   
  
```  
Hi,  
  
The attached patches add support for filtering rows in the publisher.  
The output plugin will do the work if a filter was defined in CREATE  
PUBLICATION command. An optional WHERE clause can be added after the  
table name in the CREATE PUBLICATION such as:  
  
CREATE PUBLICATION foo FOR TABLE departments WHERE (id > 2000 AND id <= 3000);  
  
Row that doesn't match the WHERE clause will not be sent to the subscribers.  
  
Patches 0001 and 0002 are only refactors and can be applied  
independently. 0003 doesn't include row filtering on initial  
synchronization.  
  
Comments?

Very, very useful.  I really do hope this patch survives the   
late-arrival-cull.  
  
I built this functionality into a test program I have been using and in   
simple cascading replication tests it works well.  
  
I did find what I think is a bug (a bug easy to avoid but also easy to   
run into):  
The test I used was to cascade 3 instances (all on one machine) from   
A->B->C  
I ran a pgbench session in instance A, and used:  
   in A: alter publication pub0_6515 add table pgbench_accounts where   
(aid between 40000 and 60000-1);  
   in B: alter publication pub1_6516 add table pgbench_accounts;  
  
The above worked well, but when I did the same but used the filter in   
both publications:  
   in A: alter publication pub0_6515 add table pgbench_accounts where   
(aid between 40000 and 60000-1);  
   in B: alter publication pub1_6516 add table pgbench_accounts where   
(aid between 40000 and 60000-1);  
  
then the replication only worked for (pgbench-)scale 1 (hence: very   
little data); with larger scales it became slow (taking many minutes   
where the above had taken less than 1 minute), and ended up using far   
too much memory (or blowing up/crashing altogether).  Something not   
quite right there.  
  
Nevertheless, I am much in favour of acquiring this functionality as   
soon as possible.  
  
Thanks,

但是需要注意，如果where条件里面用了自定义function （return boolean）时，如果这个function被删了，会导致filter 判定失败decoding失败。  
  
```  
I don't think this has anything to do with security. Stupid example:  
  
user1: CREATE EXTENSION citext;  
  
user2: CREATE FUNCTION myfilter(col1 text, col2 text) returns boolean  
language plpgsql as  
$$BEGIN  
RETURN col1::citext = col2::citext;  
END;$$  
  
user2: ALTER PUBLICATION mypub ADD TABLE mytab WHERE (myfilter(a,b));  
  
[... replication happening ...]  
  
user1: DROP EXTENSION citext;  
  
And now replication is broken and unrecoverable without data loss.  
Recreating extension will not help because the changes happening in  
meantime will not see it in the historical snapshot.  
  
I don't think it's okay to do completely nothing about this.  
```  
  
另外还需要注意，如果tuple在被更新后无法满足where 条件的情况，可能导致这条记录的前状态被订阅，后状态无法被订阅。也是使用时需要注意的。  
  
```  
>Which regression?  
Apply the 0001.patch~0005.patch and then do a 'make check', then there be a  
failed item. And when you apply the 0006.patch, the failed item disappeared.  
  
>There should be an error because you don't have a PK or REPLICA IDENTITY.  
No. I have done the 'ALTER TABLE cities  REPLICA IDENTITY FULL'.  
  
>Even if you create a PK or REPLICA IDENTITY, it won't turn this UPDATE  
>into a INSERT and send it to the other node (indeed UPDATE will be  
>sent however there isn't a tuple to update). Also, filter columns must

You should considered the Result2:  
     On publication:  
      insert into cities values('t1',1,135);  
      update cities set altitude=300 where altitude=135;  
      postgres=# table cities ;  
       name | population | altitude   
      ------+------------+----------  
       t1   |        123 |      134  
       t1   |          1 |      300  
      (2 rows)  
        
      On subscription:  
      ostgres=# table cities ;  
       name | population | altitude   
      ------+------------+----------  
       t1   |          1 |      135  
  
The tuple ('t1',1,135) appeared in both publication and subscription,  
but after an update on publication, the tuple is disappeared on   
publication and change nothing on subscription.  
  
The same with Result1, they puzzled me today and I think they will  
puzzle the users in the future. It should have a more wonderful design,  
for example, a log to notify users that there be a problem during replication  
at least.
