## 背景    
[《PostgreSQL 优化器逻辑推理能力 源码解析》](../201602/20160225_01.md)    
  
数据库优化器支持逻辑推理能力，例如  
  
where a>1 and a>2的条件，会合并为a>2  
  
where a<1 and a>2，会直接返回false  
  
在使用gin索引时，也有类似的场景，例如:    
  
```  
WHERE col LIKE '%verylongpattern%' AND col LIKE '%a%'  
```  
  
以上条件实际上只要第一个条件满足，```like '%a%'```是默认满足的，所以不需要用第二个条件去做full gin index scan。为什么第二个条件会有full index scan，因为pg_trgm插件的token是连续3个字符的token 倒排树。具体可参考如下：  
  
[《PostgreSQL 模糊查询最佳实践 - (含单字、双字、多字模糊查询方法)》](../201704/20170426_01.md)    
  
为了解决这个问题，可以改进gin的scan方法。  
  
## gin 内核优化 - 多条件逻辑推理原型讨论  
  
```  
Hi,  
  
Marc (in Cc) reported me a problematic query using a GIN index hit in  
production.  The issue is that even if an GIN opclass says that the  
index can be used for an operator, it's still possible that some  
values aren't really compatible and requires a full index scan.  
  
One simple example is with a GIN pg_trgm index (but other opclasses  
have similar restrictions) , doing a LIKE with wildcard on both side,  
where the pattern is shorter than a trigram, e.g. col LIKE '%a%'.  So,  
a where clause of the form:  
  
WHERE col LIKE '%verylongpattern%' AND col LIKE '%a%'  
  
is much more expensive than  
  
WHERE col LKE '%verylongpattern%'  
  
While there's nothing to do if the unhandled const is the only  
predicate, if there are multiple AND-ed predicates and at least one of  
them doesn't require a full index scan, we can avoid it.  
  
Attached patch tries to fix the issue by detecting such cases and  
dropping the unhandled quals in the BitmapIndexScan, letting the  
recheck in BitmapHeapScan do the proper filtering.  I'm not happy to  
call the extractQuery support functions an additional time, but i  
didn't find a cleaner way.  This is of course intended for pg13.  
```  
  
增加推理flag，打了falg的条件，将作为gin filter条件，而不是gin index scan 条件。  
  
例如之前提到的模糊查询例子，第二个条件就会被打标，变成index filter条件，不参与index scan。（当然，这个可能不会体现在explain的输出中，是gin scan内部完成的）

I've read this thread.  I decided to rewrite the patch in the way,  
which I find simple and more clear.  Attached is the draft patch  
written from scratch except regression tests, which were copied "as  
is".  It based on the discussion in this thread as well as my own  
ideas.  It works as following.  
  
1) New GinScanKey->excludeOnly flag is introduced.  This flag means  
that scan key might be satisfied even if no of its entries match the  
row.  So, such scan keys are useful only for additional check of  
results returned by other keys.  That is excludeOnly scan key is  
designed for exclusion of already obtained results.  
2) Initially no hidden scan entries are appended to  
GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL scan keys.  They are appended after getting  
statistics about search modes applied to particular attributes.  
3) We append at only one GIN_CAT_EMPTY_QUERY scan entry when all scan  
keys GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL.  If there is at least one normal scan key,  
no GIN_CAT_EMPTY_QUERY is appended.  
4) No hidden entries are appended to GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL scan key if  
there are normal scan keys for the same column.  Otherwise  
GIN_CAT_NULL_KEY hidden entry is appended.  
5) GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL scan keys, which don't have GIN_CAT_EMPTY_QUERY  
hidden entry, are marked with excludeOnly flag.  So, they are used to  
filter results of other scan keys.  
6) GIN_CAT_NULL_KEY hidden entry is found, then scan key doesn't match  
independently on result of consistent function call.  
  
Therefore, attached patch removes unnecessary GIN_CAT_EMPTY_QUERY scan  
entries without removing positive effect of filtering in  
GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL scan keys.  
  
Patch requires further polishing including comments, minor refactoring  
etc.  I'm going to continue work on this.

We have a similar solution for this problem.  The idea is to avoid full index  
scan inside GIN itself when we have some GIN entries, and forcibly recheck  
all tuples if triconsistent() returns GIN_MAYBE for the keys that emitted no  
GIN entries.  
  
The attached patch in its current shape contain at least two ugly places:  
1. We still need to initialize empty scan key to call triconsistent(), but  
    then we have to remove it from the list of scan keys.  Simple refactoring  
    of ginFillScanKey() can be helpful here.  
    
2. We need to replace GIN_SEARCH_MODE_EVERYTHING with GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL  
    if there are no GIN entries and some key requested GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL  
    because we need to skip NULLs in GIN_SEARCH_MODE_ALL.  Simplest example here  
    is "array @> '{}'": triconsistent() returns GIN_TRUE, recheck is not forced,  
    and GIN_SEARCH_MODE_EVERYTHING returns NULLs that are not rechecked.  Maybe  
    it would be better to introduce new GIN_SEARCH_MODE_EVERYTHING_NON_NULL.

衍生的场景，数组相关，同样支持逻辑推理。通过逻辑推理进行恰当打标，减少gin full scan.
