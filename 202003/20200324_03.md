## 背景          
PostgreSQL LSM-tree 引擎 - VidarDB (baseon rocksdb)  
  
底层使用rocksdb存储, lsm-tree, 高速写入.   
  
为什么要用PG? 统一用户交互体验, 降低用户学习成本, 同时能满足业务需求.   
  
使用场景包括iot, 数据分析, appweb, 流数据的接入与实时分析.

### The world's first unified database  
replace multiple data tools with a single unified database  
  
### What is VidarDB?  
VidarDB is an open-source, unified database system with lightning speed (50~1000X faster) and in-place machine learning support. No more installation, maintenance and costs of multiple data processing tools.  
  
VidarDB can do everything PostgreSQL can do, but with our technology, a versatile storage engine, we make VidarDB run like a speedy antelope.  
  
  
### How VidarDB Works?  
#### PostgreSQL Frontend  
Because VidarDB embraces PostgreSQL ecosystem, it uses the same terminal and driver as PostgreSQL. No need to change your code, while all the miracles happen underneath.  
  
#### In-place Machine Learning  
It is never required to dump your data from the database to your machine learning tool anymore. VidarDB simplifies your process by running your machine learning algorithm directly in the database via your familiar SQL.  
  
#### Blazingly Fast Querying  
Unlike general operational database, VidarDB is designed for modern memory hierarchy, with 50X faster in data ingestion and 1000X speedup querying recent data. Fresh data sit in RAM first, and will be automatically flushed to secondary memory when RAM is full.  
  
#### Responsive Data Analysis  
VidarDB natively supports business intelligence. The Column Store, an integral part of our innovative data structure, enables data analysis extremely responsive by fetching only portion of the data. Unlike general data warehouse, VidarDB ingests data up to 1000X faster.  
  
### VidarDB Use Cases  
  
#### Internet of Things (IoT)  
VidarDB not only ingests your sensor data super fast, but also enables real-time data analysis and in-place machine learning without moving your data to other tools. You can notify your customers immediately.  
  
#### Data Analysis  
Whether business intelligence or artificial intelligence, VidarDB guarantees you the interactive data analysis, and even enables you, without ETL, querying the fresh data with much more business value.  
  
#### App & Web  
VidarDB lets you focus on your business logics and web interface, because VidarDB is not only easy to use with a familiar frontend, but also it takes care of the performance of data processing for you.  
  
#### Streaming  
Monitor your software system or hardware equipment with sensors? Real-time dashboards go smoothly in VidarDB, and detecting instant accident is a piece of cake.
