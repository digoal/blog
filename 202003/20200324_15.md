Temporal Tables PostgreSQL Extension  
  
https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables  
  
A temporal table is a table that records the period of time when a row is valid. There are two types of periods: the application period (also known as valid-time or business-time) and the system period (also known as transaction-time).  
  
The system period is a column (or a pair of columns) with a system-maintained value that contains the period of time when a row is valid from a database perspective. When you insert a row into such table, the system automatically generates the values for the start and end of the period. When you update or delete a row from a system-period temporal table, the old row is archived into another table, which is called the history table.  
  
The application period is a column (or a pair of columns) with an application-maintained value that contains the period of time when a row is valid from an application perspective. This column is populated by an application.  
  
Note that these two time periods do not have to be the same for a single fact. For example, you may have a temporal table storing data about historical or even future facts. The application period of these facts differs from the system period which is set when we add or modify the facts into the table.  
  
Currently, Temporal Tables Extension supports the system-period temporal tables only.
