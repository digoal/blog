What is the VagueGeometry?  
The VagueGeometry is an extension to represent vague spatial data based on the VASA (Vague Spatial Algebra) for the PostgreSQL DBMS. PostgreSQL has free license and is an extensible DBMS which new abstract data types (ADTs) can be implemented using a low level program language (e.g. C language) or high level program language (e.g. pl/pgSQL).  
  
The VagueGeometry extension was implemented in C language using the extensibility provided by PostgreSQL internal library. This ADT uses the PostGIS extension (and because of it, the PostGIS is a dependency of VagueGeometry) internal library for crisp geometric operations that were adapted for vague spatial data. Thus, external applications can use the VagueGeometry extension accessing directly the DBMS to handle vague spatial data.

What are vague spatial data?  
While crisp spatial data have exact location and well-known boundaries, vague spatial data have inexact location or uncertain boundary. There are distinct models to represent vague spatial data. These models can be classified as: exact models [Cohn and Gotts 1995; Bejaoui et al. 2009; Pauly and Schneider 2010], rough models [Beaubouef, Ladner, and Petry 2004], probabilistic models [Cheng, Kalashnikov and Prabhakar 2003; Li et al. 2007] and fuzzy models [Dilo et al. 2007; Schneider 2008].  
  
These spatial data models discuss standards for the representation of vague spatial data as well as its operations. Consequently, there are not native support of vague spatial data in Spatial Database Management Systems (SDBMS), such as PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension. On the other hand, nowadays vague spatial data is important because modern geographic applications request its storage in situations commonly found in the real world, such as soil mapping, mountain limits mapping and air polluted areas.  
  
Thus, we use the exact models representation to implement the vague spatial objects in PostgreSQL. The exact models aims to reutilize the existing abstract data types of crisp spatial types (e.g. points, lines and regions) to represent vague spatial objects. In general, vague spatial objects are defined using two crisp spatial objects which one represent the vague spatial part and the another represents the well-known spatial part. More specifically, we use the VASA (Vague Spatial Algebra) of Pauly and Schneider (2010) to define an abstract data type in the PostgreSQL. The VASA defines a vague spatial object as a pair of crisp spatial objects of the same type topologically related as “disjoint” or “meets”.
