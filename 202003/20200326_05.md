## 背景

PG Global Temporary Tables  
==========================  
  
pgtt is a PostgreSQL extension to create and manage Oracle-style  
Global Temporary Tables. It is based on unlogged tables, Row Security  
Level and views. A background worker is responsible to periodically  
remove obsolete rows.  
  
PostgreSQL native temporary tables are automatically dropped at the  
end of a session, or optionally at the end of the current transaction.  
Oracle Global Temporary Tables (GTT) are permanent, they are created  
as regular tables visible to all users but their content is relative  
to the current session or transaction. Even if the table is persistent  
a session or transaction can not see rows written by an other session.  
  
An other difference is that Oracle Global Temporary Table can be  
created in any schema while it is not possible with PostgreSQL where  
temporary table are stored in the pg_temp namespace.  
  
Usually this is not a problem, you have learn to deal with the  
temporary table behavior of PostgreSQL but the problem comes when  
you are migrating an Oracle database to PostgreSQL. You have to  
rewrite the SQL and PlPgSQL code to follow the application logic and  
use PostgreSQL temporary table, that mean recreating the temporary  
table everywhere it is used.  
  
The other advantage of this kind of object when your application  
create and delete a lot of temporary tables this will add bloat in  
the PostgreSQL catalog and the performances will start to fall.  
Using Global Temporary Table will save this catalog bloating. They  
are permanent tables and so on permanent indexes, they will be found  
by the autovacuum process in contrary of local temporary tables.  
  
The objective of this extension it to create a POC about the Global  
Temporary Table feature. Don't expect high performances if you insert  
huge amount of tuple in these tables.  
  
Installation  
============  
  
To install the pgtt extension you need a PostgreSQL version upper than  
9.4. Untar the pgtt tarball anywhere you want then you'll need to  
compile it with pgxs. So the pg_config tool must be in your path.  
  
Depending on your installation, you may need to install some devel  
package and especially the libpq devel package. Once pg_config is in  
your path, do "make", and then "make install".  
  
Configuration  
=============  
  
The background worker used to remove obsolete rows from global  
temporary tables must be loaded on database start by adding the  
library to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf. You also  
need to load the pgtt library defining C function used by the  
extension.  
  
* shared_preload_libraries='pgtt_bgw,pgtt'  
  
You'll be able to set the two following parameters in configuration  
file:  
  
* pgtt_bgw.naptime = 5  
  
this is the interval used between each cleaning cycle, 5 seconds  
per default.  
  
* pgtt.analyze = off  
  
Force the background worker to execute an ANALYZE after each run.  
Default is off, it is better to let autoanalyze to the work.  
  
To avoid too much performances lost when the background worker is  
deleting obsolete rows the limit of rows removed at one time is  
defined by the following directive:  
  
* pgtt.chunk_size = 250000  
  
Default is to remove rows by chunk of 250000 tuples.  
  
  
Once this configuration is done, restart PostgreSQL.  
  
The background writer will wake up each naptime interval to scan  
all database using the pgtt extension. It will then remove all rows  
that don't belong to an existing session or transaction.  
  
Use of the extension  
====================  
  
In all database where you want to use Global Temporary Tables you  
will have to create the extension using:  
  
* CREATE EXTENSION pgtt;  
  
The extension comes with two functions that must be used instead of  
the CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement. To create a GTT table  
named test_table use the following statement:  
  
* SELECT pgtt_schema.pgtt_create_table('test_table', 'id integer, lbl text', true);  
  
The first argument of the pgtt_create_table() function is the name  
of the permanent temporary table. The second is the definition of  
the table. The third parameter is a boolean to indicate if the rows  
should be preserved at end of the transaction or deleted at commit.  
  
Here it could be like creating a table:  
  
	CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE test_table (  
		id integer,  
		lbl text  
	) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;  
  
  
To drop a Global Temporary Table you must use the following function:  
  
* SELECT pgtt_schema.pgtt_drop_table('test_table');  
  
Behind the functions  
=====================  
  
How the extension really works? When you call the pgtt_create_table()  
function the pgtt extension act as follow:  
  
  1) Create an unlogged table of the same name but prefixed with 'pgtt_'  
     with a "hidden" column 'pgtt_sessid' of custom type lsid.  
     The table is stored in extension schema pgtt_schema and the users  
     must not access to this table directly. They have to use the view  
     instead. The pgtt_sessid column has default to get_session_id(),  
     this function is part of the pgtt_extension and build a session  
     local unique id from the backend start time (epoch) and the pid.  
     The custom type use is a C structure of two integers:  
  
	typedef struct Lsid {  
	    int      backend_start_time;  
	    int      backend_pid;  
	} Lsid;  
  
  2) Create a btree index on column pgtt_sessid of special type lsid.  
  3) Grant SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE on the table to PUBLIC.  
  4) Activate RLS on the table and create two RLS policies to hide rows  
     to other sessions or transactions when required.  
  5) Force RLS to be active for the owner of the table.  
  6) Create an updatable view using the original table name with a  
     a WHERE clause to hide the "hidden" column of the table.  
  7) Set owner of the view to current_user which might be a superuser,  
     grants to other users are the responsability of the administrator.  
  8) Insert the relation between the GTT and the view in the catalog  
     table pgtt_global_temp.  
  
The pgtt_drop_table() function is responsible to remove all references  
to a GTT table and its corresponding view. When it is called it just  
execute a "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pgtt_schema.pgtt_tbname CASCADE;".  
Using CASCADE will also drop the associated view.  
  
The exgtension also define four functions to manipulate the 'lsid' type:  
      
* get_session_id(): generate the local session id and returns an lsid.  
* generate_lsid(int, int): generate a local session id based on a backend  
  start time (number of second since epoch) and a pid of the backend.  
  Returns an lsid.  
* get_session_start_time(lsid): returns the number of second since epoch  
  part of an lsid.  
* get_session_pid(lsid): returns the pid part of an lsid.  
  
Here is an example of use of these functions:  
```  
test=# SELECT get_session_id();  
   get_session_id     
--------------------  
 {1527703231,11007}  
  
test=# SELECT generate_lsid(1527703231,11007);  
   generate_lsid      
--------------------  
 {1527703231,11007}  
  
test=# SELECT get_session_start_time(get_session_id());  
 get_session_start_time   
------------------------  
             1527703231  
  
test=# SELECT get_session_pid(get_session_id());  
 get_session_pid   
-----------------  
           11007  
```  
  
Behind the background worker  
============================  
  
The pgtt_bgw background worker is responsible of removing all rows  
that are no more visible to any running session or transaction.  
  
To achieve that it wakes up each naptime (default 5 seconds) and  
creates dedicated dynamic background workers to connect to each  
database. When the pgtt extension is found in the database it calls  
the pgtt_schema.pgtt_maintenance() function.  
  
The first argument of the function is the iteration number, 0 mean  
that the background worker was just started so Global Temporary tables  
must be truncated. The iteration number is incremented each time  
the background worker wakes up.  
  
To avoid too much performances lost when the background worker is  
deleting rows the number of rows removed at one time is defined  
by the pgtt_chunk_size GUC. It is passed to the function as second  
parameter, default: 250000.  
  
The third parameter is use to force an ANALYZE to be perform just  
after obsolete rows have been removed. Default is to leave autoanalyze  
do the work.  
  
The pgtt_schema.pgtt_maintenance() has the following actions:  
  
  1) Look for relation id in table pgtt_schema.pgtt_global_temp.  
  2) Remove all references to the relation if it has been dropped.  
  3) If the relation exists it truncate the GTT table when the worker  
     is run at postmaster startup then exit.  
  4) For other iteration it delete rows from the Global Temporary table  
     where the pid stored in pgtt_sessid doesn't appears in view  
     pg_stat_activity or if the xmim is not fount in the same view,  
     looking at pid and backend_xid columns. Xmin is verified only if  
     the Global Temporary table is declared to delete rows on commit,  
     when preserved is false.  
  5) When an analyze is asked the function execute an ANALYZE on  
     the table after having removed obsolete tuples. THe default is to  
     let autoanalyze do is work.  
  
The function returns the total number of rows deleted. It must not be  
run manually but only run by pgtt_bgw the background worker.
