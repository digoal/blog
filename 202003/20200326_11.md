# PostgreSQL to kdb+ Extension  
This project is the implementation of a PostgreSQL extension that allows Postgres processes to access [kdb+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kdb%2B) data through its SQL interface. While Postgres has excellent transactional support for reference/master data, kdb+ offers a high-performance solution to storing and analyzing extreme volumes of timeseries data. By allowing developers to combine the data from both technologies through the standard interfaces that Postgres provides, this extension may expedite the development of new solutions.  
  
The following provides a gist of how the `pgtokdb` works. The extension has an entry point (a C function) named `getset` (Set Returning Function) that handles communications between SQL and kdb+.  
  
We now create a Postgres function that wraps `getset`. This particular function takes a kdb+ expression that returns a result set of two columns: i and j, 4-byte and 8-byte integers respectively.  
  
```sql  
create type callkdb_t as (i integer, j bigint);  
create function callkdb(varchar) returns setof callkdb_t as 'pgtokdb', 'getset' language c;  
```  
  
We have a kdb+ function defined that returns the record set. This function using in a kdb+ session that is listening on a configured port waiting for work.  
  
```q  
q)qfn[]  
i j    
-----  
1 100  
2 200  
3 300  
```  
  
Let's call that function from within Postgres.   
  
```sql  
select * from callkdb('qfn[]');  
 i |  j    
---+-----  
 1 | 100  
 2 | 200  
 3 | 300  
```  
  
Below, we have a simple Postgres table that contains some code-description values, where the i column represent the code of, say, some piece of machinery.  
  
```sql  
select * from code;  
 i |     c        
---+------------  
 1 | Compressor  
 2 | Pump  
 3 | Extruder  
```  
  
Let's join the two table inside of Postgres.   
  
```sql  
select B.i, A.c, B.j from code A, callkdb('qfn[]') B where A.i = B.i;  
 i |     c      |  j    
---+------------+-----  
 1 | Compressor | 100  
 2 | Pump       | 200  
 3 | Extruder   | 300  
```  
   
Below is a bit more complex example. We want to invoke a kdb+ function that has an integer argument (`numrows`), and returns a table with different column types.   
  
```q  
fun:{[numrows]  
    // Generate unkeyed table with <numrows> rows  
    ([]  
        id:numrows?1000; // Random bigints (j)  
        vals:numrows?999.9; // Random floats (f)  
        ts:.z.p+1000000000*til numrows; // Array of timestamps (p), starting at now   
        str:"string" ,/: string til numrows // Just some strings (C)  
        )  
   }  
```  
  
In Postgres, we create a type that maps to the names and data types of the kdb+ function result. Also, we create a function that glues it all together.  
  
```sql  
create type callfun_t as (id bigint, vals float8, ts timestamp, str varchar);  
create function callfun(varchar, integer) returns setof callfun_t as 'pgtokdb', 'getset' language c;  
select * from callfun('fun', 10);  
  
 id  |       vals       |            ts             |   str     
-----+------------------+---------------------------+---------

```  
Finally, there are many regression tests in the project [test directory](https://github.com/hughhyndman/pgtokdb/tree/master/test) that are great examples of show varying data types, arguments, results, and capabilities.    
  
## Performance  
  
Although not very scientific, the following example provides some information on the performance characteristics of the extension, as well as kdb+ and Postgres. These tests were run on my circa 2014 Macbook Pro, with an SSD drive.   
  
In kdb+, we create a 100 million row table with a single bigint column, containing the numbers from 0 rising monotonically upwards. The `\t` that follows the q prompt indicates that we want to time the operation.  
  
```q  
q)\t `:kdbtbl set ([] j:til 100000000) // Create table on disk  
1498 (ms)  
  
q)\l kdbtbl // Load table  
`kdbtbl  
  
q)select sum j from kdbtbl // Add up all the values  
j                 
----------------  
4999999950000000  
  
q)\t select sum j from kdbtbl // Time the operation  
62 (ms)  
```  
  
Below, we create at Postgres function that calls a kdb+ query, and receives a single bigint column.  
  
```sql  
postgres=# create type foo_t as (j bigint);  
postgres=# create function foo(varchar) returns setof foo_t as 'pgtokdb', 'getset' language 'c';  
```  
  
Let's invoke the function and have all 100 million rows returned to Postgres, for it to sum up the `j` value. We are essentially moving 800MB across a socket, and passing each bigint to Postgres to sum.  
  
```sql  
postgres=# select sum(j) from foo('select j from kdbtbl');  
       sum          
------------------  
 4999999950000000  
Time: 24671.273 ms (00:24.671)  
```  
  
Now, we'll copy all the data from the kdb+ table and store it in a Postgres table. After that, we'll get Postgres to do the sum of its own data.  
  
```sql  
postgres=# \timing on  
postgres=# select * into pgtbl from foo('select j from kdbtbl');  
Time: 151502.628 ms (02:31.503)  
  
postgres=# select sum(j) from pgtbl;  
       sum          
------------------  
 4999999950000000  
Time: 15614.525 ms (00:15.615)  
```  
  
Lastly, we'll shift the processing of the sum from Postgres to kdb+, which provides a much more efficient solution.   
  
```sql  
postgres=# select j from foo('select sum j from kdbtbl');  
        j           
------------------  
 4999999950000000  
Time: 71.102 ms  
```  
  
## Data Types and Conversions  
The table below summarizes the how the data types should be mapped between kdb+ and Postgres. The Code specifies the single character kdb+ datatype codes, which are used in the `genddl` functions in the `pgtokdb` namespace provided in the provided `pgtokdb.q` script file.  
  
kdb+ | Code | Postgres  
:-- | :-: | :--   
boolean | b | boolean   
GUID | g | UUID  
short | h | smallint (int2)   
int | i | int (integer, int4)  
long | j | bigint (int8)  
real | e | real (float4)   
float | f | double precision (float8)  
char | c | varchar   
symbol | s | varchar   
timestamp | p | timestamp  
date | d | date  
char[] | C | varchar  
byte[] | X | bytea  
short[] | H | smallint[]  
int[] | I | integer[]   
long[] | J | bigint[]  
real[] | E | real[]  
float[] | F | double precision[]  
  
The extension does support up-casting to data types where there won't be any data loss, for example kdb+ short to Postgres bigint. However there could be precision loss when casting integers to floats.  
  
Note that Postgres does not have a single-byte data type, so kdb+ type x should be mapped to a Postgres integer type, where it will be up-casted.   
  
## Installation  
  
The distribution files have to be placed into a directories that comprise the deployed Postgres installation. In order to determine which directories to use, Postgres provides a utility in its bin directory called `pg_config`. This utility prints configuration parameters of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL. There are a number of options available to `pgconfig` which return names of directories for distribution files. The table below summarizes each file in the pgtokdb distribution and the pg_config option to be used to identify their destination.  
  
 File | pg_config option | Notes  
 :--- | :--- | :---  
 pgtokdb.so | --pkglibdir | Shared library to be used for Mac and Linux deployments  
 pgtokdb.dll | --pkglibdir | DLL to be used for Windows deployments  
 pgtokdb.control | --sharedir | Descriptive information for the extension  
 pgtokdb.sql | --sharedir | SQL script that is run when extension is CREATED  
 c.dll | | Kx Systems C-language DLL to be placed in PATH  
 pgtokdb.q | | Kdb+ script placed somewhere convenient to the Q directories  
  
As an example, on my Mac, here are the names of the target directories.  
  
```bash  
$ pg_config --pkglibdir  
/usr/local/pgsql/lib  
$ pg_config --sharedir  
/usr/local/pgsql/share  
```  
  
Once the files are copied, start `psql` and make the extension known to Postgres via the CREATE EXTENSION command.  
  
```sql  
$ psql  
postgres=# create extension pgtokdb;  
CREATE EXTENSION  
```  
This command will fail if the files have not be placed in the correct directories. Also, in the case of Windows, if `c.dll` wasn't placed in the PATH.  
  
A smoke test is provided as part of the installation, which includes a few functions in the Postgres PGTOKDB schema. You will need to start q on the same host as Postgres listening on Port 5000 (this can be changed in postgres.config -- see configuration below).  
  
```q  
q pgtokdb.q -P 5000  
q)   
```  
  
In another session, start psql and run the following select statement. If you get information similar to below, the extension is installed correctly.  
  
```sql  
$ psql  
postgres=# select * from pgtokdb.getstatus('.pgtokdb.status[]');  
 os  | version |  release   |          timenow             
-----+---------+------------+----------------------------  
 m64 |     3.6 | 2018-11-09 | 2019-11-05 00:05:30.281957  
```  
## Configuration  
  
The postgres.config file can be modified to add the following configuration settings.  
  
Setting | Description | Default  
:-- | :-- | :--   
pgtokdb.host | host name or IP address | localhost  
pgtokdb.port | TCP/IP port | 5000  
pgtokdb.userpass | user:pass | None provided  
  
Note that configuration settings are read initially when a Postgres process loads the extension. To reread the settings, the process will need to restart.  
  
## Utilities  
Writing wrapper Postgres function and types to specific kdb+ queries is cumbersome, so convenenient utility functions (both kdb+ and Postgres) are provided with the installation.  
  
The kdb+ utilities (`genddl` and `genddle`) are found in the installations `pgtokdb.q` script and are placed in the `.pgtokdb` namespace.   
  
The example below uses a function (`qfn`) that takes an integer argument, and returns a kdb+ table with three columns: a long (j), float (f), and timestamp (p). We want to build the necessary Postgres function that can call this function.  
  
```q  
q) qfn:{[n] ([] id:til n; val:n?9999.99; ts:2019.10.01D0+1D*til n)}  
```  
The `genddl` function (Generate Data Definition Language), takes three arguments: the name of the Postgres function to be created, the kdb+ data type codes of the kdb+ functon arguments, and the meta of the function result.  
  
```  
q) ddl:.pgtokdb.genddl["call_qfn"; "i"; meta qfn[1]]  
q) ddl  
script  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
"drop function if exists call_qfn;"  
"drop type if exists _call_qfn_t;"  
"create type call_qfn_t as (id bigint, val float8, ts timestamp);"  
"create function call_qfn(varchar, integer) returns setof _call_qfn_t as 'pgtokdb','getset' language c;"  
```  
  
The result is a table containing the necessary DDL scripts. The table's contents can be stored in a text file for execution using psql. Note that the first argument to `call_qfn` above is the kdb+ function (or script) to be invoked.  
  
```  
q) `:/tmp/gen.sql 0: ddl[;`script]  
`:/tmp/gen.sql  
```  
  
```sql  
$ psql  
postgres=# \i /tmp/gen.sql  
```  
  
We can invoke a variant of `genddl` (i.e., `genddle`) from within a psql session by using the `pgtokdb.gendll` Postgres function. The difference is that the (string) expression that generates the meta is provided.  
  
```  
postgres=# select * from pgtokdb.genddl('.pgtokdb.genddle', 'call_qfn','i','metaqfn[1]');  
script                                                           
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
drop function if exists call_qfn;  
drop type if exists call_qfn_t;  
create type call_qfn_t as (id bigint, val float8, ts timestamp);  
create function call_qfn(varchar, integer) returns setof call_qfn_t as 'pgtokdb','getset' language c;  
```  
One can write this to a text file for execution as follows.  
  
```  
postgres=# copy (select * from pgtokdb.genddl(...)) to '/tmp/f.sql';  
```  
  
## Building the Extension  
  
In order to build the extension, download the Postgres source from [postgres.org](https://www.postgresql.org/) and perform build and install. The Mac and Linux builds are quite straightforward using standard toolsets, however Windows required using Visual Studio and following the instructions on the Postgres site: [Building with Visual C++ or the Microsoft Windows SDK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/install-windows-full.html).  
  
I built the Windows version of Postgres by using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, with [ActiveState Perl](https://www.activestate.com/).   
  
Once you have built and installed Postgres, the `pgtokdb` extension can be built. Two makefiles are provided: `makefile` (using make) for Linux and Mac builds, and `makefile.win` (using nmake) for Windows builds.   
  
The makefiles have three targets: clean, all, and install. It is important to have pg_config in the path, since the Linux and Mac makefiles invoke it in order to determine necessary directories (e.g., include, libs, etc.). The Windows makefile has to be provided the value for PGROOT, which is the root directory of Postgres.  
  
* make [clean | **all** | install] [DEBUG=0 | **1**]  
* nmake -f makefile.win [clean | **all** | install] [PGROOT=dir] [DEBUG=0 | **1**]  
  
The Windows build requires you to the build inside of the command shell entitled *x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019*. Furthermore, you should have clang installed, since this is the compiler used. When debugging under Windows, you can use the debugger in Visual Studio, however the pgtokdb.pdb (debug symbols) file should be moved to the same directory as pgtokdb.dll.  
  
## Regression Tests  
The project has a test directory that contains a lengthy PGSQL script (and matching kdb+ script) that runs through both happy and exception paths of the extension. To run these tests, first start a local instance of kdb+ that loads its script file and listens on port 5000.  
  
```  
$ q pgtokdb/test/pgtokdb_test.q -p 5000  
"Ready to run tests."  
q)   
```  
  
Then start psql and invoke its test script.  
  
```  
$ psql --quiet --file pgtokdb/test/pgtokdb_test.sql  
Creating test schema: pgtokdb_test  
************** Happy Path Testing **************  
** Test01: Simple connectivity  
 j   
---  
 0  
(1 row)  
...  
************** Exception Path Testing **************  
** Testxx: Error on kdb+ not returning unkeyed table  
psql:dev/pgtokdb/test/pgtokdb_test.sql:xx: ERROR:  Result from kdb+ must be unkeyed table  
** Testxx: Unsupported argument types  
psql:dev/pgtokdb/test/pgtokdb_test.sql:xx: ERROR:  Argument 1 uses an unsupported type  
...  
```  
  
The Happy Path Testing should not produce any errors, while the Exception Path Testing should only produce those errors that are emited from the extension.
