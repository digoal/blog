## 背景         
https://github.com/citusdata/pgmasq  
  
只读库当分析库使用时, 分析通常比较复杂, 会有中间结果, 中间结果如何保持?是个问题, 因为只读库是只读的, 无法保存数据, pgmasq通过在只读库实现透明ddl dml传输到主库, 实现了只读库的写, 同时只读库会及时收到写结果.  
  
# pgmasq  
  
Pgmasq is a PostgreSQL extension that transparently forwards transactions from a hot standby to a primary to enable DDL and DML from any node, while providing a means of offloading some SELECTs to a standby.   
  
Pqmasq is currently a prototype, with some important [limitations](#limitations).  
  
# Installation  
  
Compile the extension from source:  
  
```  
git clone https://github.com/citusdata/pgmasq.git  
cd pgmasq  
make && sudo PATH=$PATH make install  
```  
  
# Setting up pgmasq  
  
Add the following to postgresql.conf:  
  
```  
shared_preload_libraries = 'pgmasq'  
pgmasq.execute_locally = immutable # one of: none, immutable, selects  
lock_timeout = '2s'  
```  
  
The `pgmasq.execute_locally` setting controls which queries are executed locally on the standby. The following settings are supported:  
  
- `none` forwards all commands to the primary.  
- `immutable` executes selects outside of a transactino block that contain no functions that could modify the database on the standby.  
- `selects` executes all selects outside of a transaction block on the standby.  
  
Additionally, we recommend setting `synchronous_commit = remote_apply` on the primary to provide read-your-writes consistency.  
  
To enable pgmasq in a particular database, run `CREATE EXTENSION pgmasq` in that database on the primary.  
  
# Authentication  
  
For pgmasq to work your replication user also needs to be superuser. You can make that the case by running:  
  
```  
ALTER USER replicator SUPERUSER;  
```  
  
In addition, you may need to add a line to pg_hba.conf to ensure access to the database, in addition to replication access:  
  
```  
host replication replicator 10.0.0.0/8 md5  
host all replicator 10.0.0.0/8 md5  
```  
  
# Limitations  
  
`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` is not supported as the parser on the hot standby cannot see the temporary table.  
  
Multi-statement transactions of the form `BEGIN; [DDL on table X]; [SELECT/DML on table X]; COMMIT;` may create an *undetectable deadlock*, since the DDL will take an exclusive lock when it gets replicated, which will cause the parser to block when processing the SELECT/DML.
