## 背景       
根据日志等级, 错误代码过滤日志打印. 用处挺多, 例如你不想打印一些业务代码的错误, 比如pk冲突, 约束冲突等.             
  
pgloggingfilter  
===============  
  
pgloggingfilter is a filter module for PostgreSQL logging.  It can be used  
to suppress logging of various expected errors which is especially useful in  
cases where users are allowed to call stored procedures with potentially  
invalid arguments.  
  
To enable pgloggingfilter it needs to be included in postgresql.conf's  
shared_preload_libraries list after which control minimum error levels for  
logging per sqlstate using the two new GUCs, for example:  
  
  pgloggingfilter.log_min_messages_by_sqlstate = '22012:PANIC'  
  pgloggingfilter.log_min_error_statement_by_sqlstate = 'P0001:PANIC,23503:PANIC'  
  
would set the minimum error level for logging division by zero errors to  
PANIC essentially disabling their logging and also prevent statements  
causing PL/pgSQL 'RAISE EXCEPTION' and foreign key violations from being  
logged.  
  
Note that this module can only increase the minimum error level from the  
base values set with log_min_messages and log_min_error_statement - i.e.  
if statement logging is not globally enabled this module can't enable it  
for any SQLSTATEs.  
  
See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/errcodes-appendix.html for  
the list of SQLSTATEs.
