## 背景        
有别于bitmap scan, bitmap index 是一种索引. greenplum支持, oracle支持, 通常用于唯一值较少, 数据量较大, 几乎没有变化的数据的聚合查询.

On-disk Bitmap Index in PostgreSQL  
=====================================  
This repository has an on-disk bitmap index access method embeddedin PostgreSQL 8.3.23 kernel.  
  
As is known to all, PostgreSQL official releases do not provide on-disk version bitmap index access method. This prevents many Postgres database addicts from testing bitmap index performance.  
  
In fact, back to 2006 - 2008, Postgres Global Development Group were trying to implement this index and delivering it as a patch. However, afterwards, they gave up this plan and removed this prototype from the official Postgres release. The patch's source code is partially available at Greenplum Database and Postgres Community Mailing List and it relies on an unreleased version of Postgres which is between 8.2 and 8.3 (I have not figured it out).   
  
We combined the fragments of this on-disk bitmap index patch, modified them and implemented this index into PostgreSQL 8.3.23 offical release. Researchs now can play this bitmap index and try to compare it with any other indexes.   
  
Note that: the performance of this on-disk bitmap index patch is very unstable and not fully tested. The reliability is not guaranteed.  
  
#Play around with Bitmap Index  
  
For the ease of testing, we have implemented this on-disk Bitmap Index into PostgreSQL kernel (8.3.23) as one of the backend access methods. This verision is designed to be run on a Linux operating system.  
  
## Download the source code  
```  
https://github.com/jiayuasu/bitmap-postgresql.git  
```  
## Build and Installation  
Once you've synced with GitHub, the folder should contain the source code for PostgreSQL. The build and installation steps are exactly same with official PostgreSQL.  
  
Note that: Due to some issues of GCC compiler, you have to use an old version of GCC (gcc 4.7 works for this) to compile the source code. Otherwise, the binary code won't work.  
  
  
```  
$ cd SourceFolder  
$ ./configure  
$ make  
$ su  
$ make install  
$ adduser postgres  
$ mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data  
$ chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data  
$ su - postgres  
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data  
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &  
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test  
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test  
```  
  
## PostgreSQL Regression Test  
  
After the installation, you have to make sure the source code on your machine pass all the PostgreSQL Regression Tests (115 in total).  
```  
$ cd SourceFolder  
  
$ make check  
```  
  
## Usage in SQL  
  
Here list some SQL commands of Bitmap index. For more details, please see the following Bitmap index test SQL script:  
```  
./src/test/regress/sql/bitmap_index.sql  
  
```  
  
### Build Bitmap Index  
```  
CREATE INDEX bitmap_idx ON bitmap_tbl USING bitmap(randomNumber);  
  
```  
  
### Query Bitmap Index  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM bitmap_tbl WHERE randomNumber = 1;  
```  
  
### Drop Bitmap Index  
```  
DROP INDEX bitmap_idx;  
```  
### Currently supported data type  
  
Integer (stable), and most of the common data types in Postgres (unstable)  
  
### Currently supported operator  
  
```  
<, <=, =, >=, >  
```  
  
  
  
For using Bitmap Index in PostgreSQL Regression Test Mode, you need to  
  
* Read and change Bitmap index test SQL script:  
  
```  
./src/test/regress/sql/bitmap_index.sql  
  
```  
* View Bitmap index test SQL script output:  
  
```  
./src/test/regress/results/bitmap_index.out  
  
```  
  
* Modify Regression Test schedule if necessary  
  
```  
./src/test/regress/parallel_schedule  
```

***  
PostgreSQL Database Management System  
=====================================  
    
This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL  
database management system.  
  
PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system  
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including  
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types  
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.  
  
PostgreSQL has many language interfaces including some of the more  
common listed below:  
  
C++ - http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/  
JDBC - http://jdbc.postgresql.org  
ODBC - http://odbc.postgresql.org  
Perl - http://search.cpan.org/~dbdpg/  
PHP - http://www.php.net  
Python - http://www.initd.org/  
Ruby - http://ruby.scripting.ca/postgres/  
  
Other language binding are available from a variety of contributing  
parties.  
  
PostgreSQL also has a great number of procedural languages available,  
a short, incomplete list is below:  
  
PL/pgSQL - included in PostgreSQL source distribution  
PL/Perl - included in PostgreSQL source distribution  
PL/PHP - http://projects.commandprompt.com/projects/public/plphp  
PL/Python - included in PostgreSQL source distribution  
PL/Java - http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pljava/  
PL/Tcl - included in PostgreSQL source distribution  
  
See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install  
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and  
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other  
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL  
system.  Changes between all PostgreSQL releases are recorded in the  
file HISTORY.  Copyright and license information can be found in the  
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this  
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation  
instructions.
