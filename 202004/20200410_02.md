PG 13 pg_stat_statements支持跟踪plan统计信息, 有什么用?  
  
1、OLTP场景, 并发高, sql简单同时基本上同一sql可以使用一个单一执行计划, 除非数据发生倾斜(PG的绑定变量可以通过custom plan算法解决), 所以让数据库尽量少的开销浪费在执行计划上.  
  
[《执行计划选择算法 与 绑定变量 - PostgreSQL prepared statement: SPI_prepare, prepare|execute COMMAND, PL/pgsql STYLE: custom & generic   
plan cache》](../201212/20121224_01.md)    
  
2、OLAP场景, 并发低, 但是SQL复杂, 数据范围广, 不适合单一执行计划, 所以建议使用每次调用sql时重新生成执行计划.

    Allow pg_stat_statements to track planning statistics.  
  
    This commit makes pg_stat_statements support new GUC  
    pg_stat_statements.track_planning. If this option is enabled,  
    pg_stat_statements tracks the planning statistics of the statements,  
    e.g., the number of times the statement was planned, the total time  
    spent planning the statement, etc. This feature is useful to check  
    the statements that it takes a long time to plan. Previously since  
    pg_stat_statements tracked only the execution statistics, we could  
    not use that for the purpose.  
  
    The planning and execution statistics are stored at the end of  
    each phase separately. So there are not always one-to-one relationship  
    between them. For example, if the statement is successfully planned  
    but fails in the execution phase, only its planning statistics are stored.  
    This may cause the users to be able to see different pg_stat_statements  
    results from the previous version. To avoid this,  
    pg_stat_statements.track_planning needs to be disabled.  
  
    This commit bumps the version of pg_stat_statements to 1.8  
    since it changes the definition of pg_stat_statements function.

例子  
  
查询sql的plan次数, 总plan耗时.  
  
```  
=# PREPARE s1 AS SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class;  
PREPARE  
=# EXECUTE s1;  
 count  
-------  
   387  
(1 row)  
  
[... 5 more times ...]  
  
=# SELECT query, plans, total_plan_time, total_plan_time / plans AS avg_plan,  
   calls, total_exec_time, total_exec_time / calls AS avg_exec  
   FROM pg_stat_statements  
   WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class%';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+--------------------------------------------  
query           | PREPARE s1 AS SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class  
plans           | 1  
total_plan_time | 2.119496  
avg_plan        | 2.119496  
calls           | 6  
total_exec_time | 3.4918280000000004  
avg_exec        | 0.5819713333333334  
```  
  
PG 13 支持explain buffers显示plan时的buffers开销, 例如生成执行计划时, 读取catalog内容产生的shared buffer hint

    Include information on buffer usage during planning phase, in EXPLAIN output, take two.  
  
    When BUFFERS option is enabled, EXPLAIN command includes the information  
    on buffer usage during each plan node, in its output. In addition to that,  
    this commit makes EXPLAIN command include also the information on  
    buffer usage during planning phase, in its output. This feature makes it  
    easier to discern the cases where lots of buffer access happen during  
    planning.  
  
    This commit revives the original commit ed7a509571 that was reverted by  
    commit 19db23bcbd. The original commit had to be reverted because  
    it caused the regression test failure on the buildfarm members prion and  
    dory. But since commit c0885c4c30 got rid of the caues of the test failure,  
    the original commit can be safely introduced again.
