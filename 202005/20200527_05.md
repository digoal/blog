Introduction
============

**pg_restrict** is an extension to restrict some SQL commands on [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). It introduces the master role concept that is similar to superuser. Even superusers can be forbid to drop databases and roles (if it is not a master role).

Requirements
============

* PostgreSQL 9.3+

Build and Install
=================

This extension is supported on [those platforms](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/supported-platforms.html) that PostgreSQL is. The installation steps depend on your operating system.

You can also keep up with the latest fixes and features cloning the Git repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eulerto/pg_restrict.git
```

Unix based Operating Systems
----------------------------

Before use this extension, you should build it and install it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eulerto/pg_restrict.git
$ cd pg_restrict
# Make sure your path includes the bin directory that contains the correct `pg_config`
$ PATH=/path/to/pg/bin:$PATH
$ make
$ make install
```

Windows
-------

There are several ways to build **pg_restrict** on Windows. If you are build PostgreSQL too, you can put **pg_restrict** directory inside contrib, change the contrib Makefile (variable SUBDIRS) and build it following the [Installation from Source Code on Windows](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/install-windows.html) instructions. However, if you already have PostgreSQL installed, it is also possible to compile **pg_restrict** out of the tree. Edit `pg_restrict.vcxproj` file and change `c:\postgres\pg113` to the PostgreSQL prefix directory. The next step is to open this project file in MS Visual Studio and compile it. Final step is to copy `pg_restrict.dll` to the `pg_config --pkglibdir` directory.

Configuration
=============

In order to function, this extension must be loaded via `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

There are several configuration parameters that control the behavior of **pg_restrict**. The default behavior is to restrict drop databases `postgres`, `template1`, and `template0` and disallow removal of role `postgres`. Role `postgres` can drop any restricted database/role (because it is a master role, by default).

* `pg_restrict.alter_system` (boolean): restrict ALTER SYSTEM command to master roles (`pg_restrict.master_roles` parameter). Default is _false_.
* `pg_restrict.copy_program` (boolean): restrict COPY ... PROGRAM command to master roles (`pg_restrict.master_roles` parameter). Default is _false_.
* `pg_restrict.master_roles` (string): Roles that are allowed to execute the restricted commands. If there is more than one role, separate them with comma. Default is _postgres_.
* `pg_restrict.nonremovable_databases` (string): restrict DROP databases listed here to a master role (even if the current role is the database owner or superuser). Default is _postgres, template1, template0_.
* `pg_restrict.nonremovable_roles` (string): restrict DROP roles listed here to a master role (even if the current role has CREATEROLE privilege or is a superuser). Default is _postgres_.

These parameters are set in `postgresql.conf`. Typical usage might be:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_restrict'
pg_restrict.alter_system = on
pg_restrict.copy_program = off
pg_restrict.master_roles = 'euler, admin'
pg_restrict.nonremovable_databases = 'prod, bi, mydb, postgres, template1, template0'
pg_restrict.nonremovable_roles = 'admin, euler, fulano'
```

Example
=======

The following parameters are set in `postgresql.conf`.

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_restrict'
pg_restrict.master_roles = 'euler, postgres'
pg_restrict.nonremovable_databases = 'prod, bi, postgres, template1, template0'
pg_restrict.nonremovable_roles = 'admin, euler'
```

Let's create a new superuser called `fulano` and connect as `fulano`. Role `fulano` **is not** a master role. If `fulano` tries to drop a role `euler` (`euler` is listed as non-removable by non-master role), it errors out. Even though `fulano` creates a database called `prod`, it **can not** remove it because `prod` is listed as non-removable and `fulano` is not a master role.

```
postgres=# CREATE ROLE fulano SUPERUSER LOGIN;
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# \c - fulano
You are now connected to database "euler" as user "fulano".
postgres=# SELECT current_role;
 current_role 
--------------
 fulano
(1 row)

postgres=# SHOW pg_restrict.master_roles;
 pg_restrict.master_roles 
--------------------------
 euler, postgres
(1 row)

postgres=# SHOW pg_restrict.nonremovable_roles;
 pg_restrict.nonremovable_roles 
--------------------------------
 admin, euler
(1 row)

postgres=# DROP ROLE euler;
psql: ERRO:  cannot drop role "euler"
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE prod;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# SELECT current_role;
 current_role 
--------------
 fulano
(1 row)

postgres=# SHOW pg_restrict.nonremovable_databases;
    pg_restrict.nonremovable_databases        
------------------------------------------
 prod, bi, postgres, template1, template0
(1 row)

postgres=# DROP DATABASE prod;
psql: ERRO:  cannot drop database "prod"
```
