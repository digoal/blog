## 背景      
现实世界中很多前缀搜索, 按一定编码规则分配号段, 例如区号、手机号段、身份证等, 与地域、国家、省份等相关.   
  
前缀搜索功能插件除了使用ltree插件, 也可以使用prefix插件. 适合gist索引.

# Prefix Opclass  
  
This module is written by Dimitri Fontaine with a great amount of help from  
RhodiumToad (formely known as AndrewSN), who was the one advising for a  
*GiST opclass* to solve the prefix matching problem.  
  
## Presentation  
  
Prefix matching is both very common and important in telephony  
applications, where call routing and costs depend on matching  
caller/callee phone number to an operator prefix.  
  
Let's say the prefixes table is called `prefixes`, a typical query  
will try to match a phone number to the longest prefix in the table:  
  
    SELECT *   
      FROM prefixes  
     WHERE prefix @> '0123456789'  
    ORDER BY length(prefix) DESC  
      LIMIT 1;  
  
## Installation  
  
### debian and ubuntu packages  
  
Replace the PostgreSQL major version number here by the one you're running  
(pick either `9.1` or `9.2`):  
  
    apt-get install postgresql-9.2-prefix  
	psql ...  
	=# create extension prefix;  
  
### fedora, red hat, centos and scientific linux packages  
  
Replace the PostgreSQL major version number here by the one you're running  
(pick either `91` or `92`):  
  
    yum install prefix92  
	psql ...  
	=# create extension prefix;  
  
### from sources  
  
Check `$PATH`, then  
  
    make  
    make install  
    psql <connection string> -c 'CREATE EXTENSION prefix;'  
  
The `make install` step might have to be done as `root`, and the psql one  
has to be done as a PostgreSQL *superuser*.  
  
### before 9.1 (consider an upgrade)  
  
If you're running a very old PostgreSQL version such as `8.3`, `8.4` of  
`9.0` you can still install this extension manually:  
  
    psql ...  
	=# \i /usr/share/postgresql/X.Y/extension/prefix--1.2.0.sql  
  
You still have to edit this example to replace X.Y with your local  
PostgreSQL version number, such as `8.4`.  
  
## Uninstall  
  
It's as easy as:  
  
    DROP TYPE prefix_range CASCADE;  
  
## Usage  
  
### Table and index creation  
  
    create table prefixes (  
           prefix    prefix_range primary key,  
           name      text not null,  
           shortname text,  
           status    char default 'S',  
  
           check( status in ('S', 'R') )  
    );  
    comment on column prefixes.status is 'S:   - R: reserved';  
      
    \copy prefixes from 'prefixes.fr.csv' with delimiter ; csv quote '"'  
  
    create index idx_prefix on prefixes using gist(prefix);  
   
### Simple tests  
  
    dim=# select '123'::prefix_range @> '123456';  
     ?column?  
    ----------  
     t  
    (1 row)  
  
Please note earlier versions of `prefix` didn't use any restriction  
nor join selectivity estimator functions for the `@>` operator, so you  
had to `set enable_seqscan to off` to use the index. That's no more  
the case, the `@>` operator uses `contsel` and `contjoinsel` and the  
planner is able to figure out by itself when to use the index or not.  
  
If you don't understand previous mention, ignore it and use a more  
recent version of `prefix` than `0.2`.  
  
#### Forcing seqcan  
  
    dim=# select * from ranges where prefix @> '0146640123';  
     prefix |      name      | shortname | state  
    --------+----------------+-----------+-------  
     0146[] | FRANCE TELECOM | FRTE      | S  
    (1 row)  
      
    Time: 4,071 ms  
  
    dim=# select * from ranges where prefix @> '0100091234';  
      prefix  |    name    | shortname | state  
    ----------+------------+-----------+-------  
     010009[] | LONG PHONE | LGPH      | S  
    (1 row)  
      
    Time: 4,110 ms  
  
#### Using the Index  
  
    dim=# select * from ranges where prefix @> '0146640123';  
     prefix |      name      | shortname | state  
    --------+----------------+-----------+-------  
     0146[] | FRANCE TELECOM | FRTE      | S  
    (1 row)  
      
    Time: 1,036 ms  
  
    dim=# select * from ranges where prefix @> '0100091234';  
      prefix  |    name    | shortname | state  
    ----------+------------+-----------+-------  
     010009[] | LONG PHONE | LGPH      | S  
    (1 row)  
      
    Time: 0,771 ms  
  
As of version 1.0, `prefix_range` GiST index supports also queries using the  
`<@`, `&&` and `=` operators (see below).  
  
### creating prefix_range, cast to and from text  
  
There's a *constructor* function:  
  
    prefix=# select prefix_range('123');  
     prefix_range   
    --------------  
     123  
    (1 row)  
  
    prefix=# select prefix_range('123', '4', '5');  
     prefix_range   
    --------------  
     123[4-5]  
    (1 row)  
  
Casting from unknown literal or text is as easy as usual:  
  
    prefix=# select '123'::prefix_range;  
     prefix_range   
    --------------  
     123  
    (1 row)  
  
    prefix=# select x, x::prefix_range from (values('123'), ('123[4-5]'), ('[2-3]')) as t(x);  
        x     |    x       
    ----------+----------  
     123      | 123  
     123[4-5] | 123[4-5]  
     [2-3]    | [2-3]  
    (3 rows)  
  
And two casts are provided:  
  
    CREATE CAST (text as prefix_range) WITH FUNCTION prefix_range(text) AS IMPLICIT;  
    CREATE CAST (prefix_range as text) WITH FUNCTION text(prefix_range);  
  
Which means you can use text expression in a context where a `prefix_range`  
is expected and it'll get implicit casting, but `prefix_range` to text has  
to be asked explicitely, so that you don't get strange behavior.  
  
### Provided operators  
  
The prefix module is all about indexing prefix lookups, but in order to be  
able to do this with some efficiency, it has to know a lot about prefix  
ranges, such as basic comparing, containment, union, intersection and  
overlapping.  
  
The operators `<=`, `<`, `=`, `<>`, `>=` and `>` are read as usual, `@>` is  
read *contains*, `<@` is read *is contained by*, `&&` is read *overlaps*,  
and `|` is *union* and `&` is *intersect*.  
  
    prefix=# select a, b,  
      a <= b as "<=", a < b as "<", a = b as "=", a <> b as "<>", a >= b as ">=", a > b as ">",  
      a @> b as "@>", a <@ b as "<@", a && b as "&&"  
    from  (select a::prefix_range, b::prefix_range  
             from (values('123', '123'),  
                         ('123', '124'),  
                         ('123', '123[4-5]'),  
                         ('123[4-5]', '123[2-7]'),  
                         ('123', '[2-3]')) as t(a, b)  
          ) as x;  
        a     |    b     | <= | < | = | <> | >= | > | @> | <@ | &&   
    ----------+----------+----+---+---+----+----+---+----+----+----  
     123      | 123      | t  | f | t | f  | t  | f | t  | t  | t

     123      | [2-3]    | t  | t | f | t  | f  | f | f  | f  | f  
    (5 rows)  
  
    prefix=# select a, b, a | b as union, a & b as intersect   
      from  (select a::prefix_range, b::prefix_range  
               from (values('123', '123'),   
                           ('123', '124'),   
                           ('123', '123[4-5]'),  
                           ('123[4-5]', '123[2-7]'),   
                           ('123', '[2-3]')) as t(a, b)  
            ) as x;  
        a     |    b     |  union   | intersect   
    ----------+----------+----------+-----------

     123      | 124      | 12[3-4]  |   
     123      | 123[4-5] | 123      | 123  
     123[4-5] | 123[2-7] | 123[2-7] | 123[4-5]  
     123      | [2-3]    | [1-3]    |   
    (5 rows)
