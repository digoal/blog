## 背景        
  
copy 命令新增binary格式, 这个格式的存储更加紧凑, 节约存储空间, 同时有一定性能提升. 支持send, recv函数的类型支持binary格式copy.    
  
  
FORMAT  
Selects the data format to be read or written: text, csv (Comma Separated Values), or binary.   
The default is text.  
  
  
Binary Format  
The binary format option causes all data to be stored/read as binary format rather than as text.   
It is somewhat faster than the text and CSV formats,   
but a binary-format file is less portable across machine architectures and PostgreSQL versions.   
Also, the binary format is very data type specific;   
for example it will not work to output binary data from a smallint column and read it into an integer column,   
even though that would work fine in text format.  
  
The binary file format consists of a file header, zero or more tuples containing the row data, and a file trailer.   
Headers and data are in network byte order.  
  
Note  
PostgreSQL releases before 7.4 used a different binary file format.  
        
Presently, all data values in a binary-format file are assumed to be in binary format (format code one).   
It is anticipated that a future extension might add a header field that allows per-column format codes to be specified.  
  
To determine the appropriate binary format for the actual tuple data you should consult the PostgreSQL source,   
in particular the *send and *recv functions for each column's data type   
(typically these functions are found in the ```src/backend/utils/adt/``` directory of the source distribution).

Improve performance of binary COPY FROM through better buffering.  
  
At least on Linux and macOS, fread() turns out to have far higher  
per-call overhead than one could wish.  Reading 64KB of data at a time  
and then parceling it out with our own memcpy logic makes binary COPY  
from a file significantly faster --- around 30% in simple testing for  
cases with narrow text columns (on Linux ... even more on macOS).  
  
In binary COPY from frontend, there's no per-call fread(), and this  
patch introduces an extra layer of memcpy'ing, but it still manages  
to eke out a small win.  Apparently, the control-logic overhead in  
CopyGetData() is enough to be worth avoiding for small fetches.
