## 背景       
并行计算, seq scan, 每个worker逐一block扫描, 导致可能文件系统read ahead(预读)无实际效果, IO打到块设备变得离散, 影响性能.  
  
使用chunk 方式, 批量IO, 性能更好.

Allocate consecutive blocks during parallel seqscans  
  
Previously we would allocate blocks to parallel workers during a parallel  
sequential scan 1 block at a time.  Since other workers were likely to  
request a block before a worker returns for another block number to work  
on, this could lead to non-sequential I/O patterns in each worker which  
could cause the operating system's readahead to perform poorly or not at  
all.  
  
Here we change things so that we allocate consecutive "chunks" of blocks  
to workers and have them work on those until they're done, at which time  
we allocate another chunk for the worker.  The size of these chunks is  
based on the size of the relation.  
  
Initial patch here was by Thomas Munro which showed some good improvements  
just having a fixed chunk size of 64 blocks with a simple ramp-down near  
the end of the scan. The revisions of the patch to make the chunk size  
based on the relation size and the adjusted ramp-down in powers of two was  
done by me, along with quite extensive benchmarking to determine the  
optimal chunk sizes.  
  
For the most part, benchmarks have shown significant performance  
improvements for large parallel sequential scans on Linux, FreeBSD and  
Windows using SSDs.  It's less clear how this affects the performance of  
cloud providers.  Tests done so far are unable to obtain stable enough  
performance to provide meaningful benchmark results.  It is possible that  
this could cause some performance regressions on more obscure filesystems,  
so we may need to later provide users with some ability to get something  
closer to the old behavior.  For now, let's leave that until we see that  
it's really required.
