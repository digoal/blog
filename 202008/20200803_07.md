## 背景       
work_mem参数用于hash聚合、join, 排序, 分组聚合等.     
    
但是实际上hash操作相比排序, 分组聚合等更耗费内存, 而sql通常属于分析类sql, 调用相比于排序更低频.    
    
为了低频的sql去设置非常大的work_mem, 可能会导致oom, 因为排序, 分组聚合的sql较多, 导致了oom.    
    
PG 13允许单独设置hash操作的mem, 通过hash_mem_multiplier参数来设置, 意思是work_mem的倍数, 调大hash_mem_multiplier可以提高hash操作性能.

Add hash_mem_multiplier GUC.    
    
Add a GUC that acts as a multiplier on work_mem.  It gets applied when    
sizing executor node hash tables that were previously size constrained    
using work_mem alone.    
    
The new GUC can be used to preferentially give hash-based nodes more    
memory than the generic work_mem limit.  It is intended to enable admin    
tuning of the executor's memory usage.  Overall system throughput and    
system responsiveness can be improved by giving hash-based executor    
nodes more memory (especially over sort-based alternatives, which are    
often much less sensitive to being memory constrained).    
    
The default value for hash_mem_multiplier is 1.0, which is also the    
minimum valid value.  This means that hash-based nodes continue to apply    
work_mem in the traditional way by default.    
    
hash_mem_multiplier is generally useful.  However, it is being added now    
due to concerns about hash aggregate performance stability for users    
that upgrade to Postgres 13 (which added disk-based hash aggregation in    
commit 1f39bce0).  While the old hash aggregate behavior risked    
out-of-memory errors, it is nevertheless likely that many users actually    
benefited.  Hash agg's previous indifference to work_mem during query    
execution was not just faster; it also accidentally made aggregation    
resilient to grouping estimate problems (at least in cases where this    
didn't create destabilizing memory pressure).    
    
hash_mem_multiplier can provide a certain kind of continuity with the    
behavior of Postgres 12 hash aggregates in cases where the planner    
incorrectly estimates that all groups (plus related allocations) will    
fit in work_mem/hash_mem.  This seems necessary because hash-based    
aggregation is usually much slower when only a small fraction of all    
groups can fit.  Even when it isn't possible to totally avoid hash    
aggregates that spill, giving hash aggregation more memory will reliably    
improve performance (the same cannot be said for external sort    
operations, which appear to be almost unaffected by memory availability    
provided it's at least possible to get a single merge pass).    
    
The PostgreSQL 13 release notes should advise users that increasing    
hash_mem_multiplier can help with performance regressions associated    
with hash aggregation.  That can be taken care of by a later commit.

Backpatch: 13-, where disk-based hash aggregation was introduced.    
```    
    
另外PG 13也支持了disk based hash.

Disk-based Hash Aggregation.    
    
While performing hash aggregation, track memory usage when adding new    
groups to a hash table. If the memory usage exceeds work_mem, enter    
"spill mode".    
    
In spill mode, new groups are not created in the hash table(s), but    
existing groups continue to be advanced if input tuples match. Tuples    
that would cause a new group to be created are instead spilled to a    
logical tape to be processed later.    
    
The tuples are spilled in a partitioned fashion. When all tuples from    
the outer plan are processed (either by advancing the group or    
spilling the tuple), finalize and emit the groups from the hash    
table. Then, create new batches of work from the spilled partitions,    
and select one of the saved batches and process it (possibly spilling    
recursively).
