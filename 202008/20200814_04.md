pg_catcheck用于检测catalog是否损坏, 坏在哪.        
        
因为PG的结构, 关系, 定义都存储在元数据中, 如果元数据损坏, 可能导致数据无法被解析等问题.         
    
元数据通常不会损坏, 元数据的变更也会写wal日志, 所以只要数据可靠性相关参数配置正确(如fpw,fsync等), 并且介质没有坏的话catalog理论上不会损坏.      
        
What is pg_catcheck?        
====================        
        
pg_catcheck is a simple tool for diagnosing system catalog corruption.        
If you suspect that your system catalogs are corrupted, this tool may        
help you figure out exactly what problems you have and how serious they        
are.  If you are paranoid, you can run it routinely to search for system        
catalog corruption that might otherwise go undetected.  However, pg_catcheck        
is not a general corruption detector.  For that, you should use PostgreSQL's        
checksum feature (`initdb -k`).        
        
PostgreSQL stores the metadata for SQL objects such as tables and functions        
using special tables called system catalog tables.  Users do not normally        
modify these tables directly, but instead modify them using SQL commands        
such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.  If the system catalog tables become        
corrupted, you may experience errors when attempting to access your data.        
Sometimes, it can be impossible to back up your data using pg_dump without        
correcting these errors.  pg_catcheck won't tell you how to your database        
got corrupted in the first place, and it won't tell you how to fix it.        
But it will usually be able to give you detailed information about what        
is broken, which may make it easier for you (or your PostgreSQL support        
provider) to understand what has gone wrong and explain the options for        
recovery.        
        
How Do I Run pg_catcheck?        
=========================        
        
pg_catcheck takes the same arguments as most other PostgreSQL utilites,        
such as -h for the host or -p for the port.  You can also pass it a        
connection string or URL, just like psql.  For a full list of options,        
run `pg_catcheck --help`.  If pg_catcheck isn't already installed, you might        
need to build it first.  If no pre-compiled binary package is available for        
you to install, see the instructions below for "Building on UNIX/Linux" and        
"Building on Windows".        
        
When you run pg_catcheck, it will normally print out a line that looks like        
this:        
        
	progress: done (0 inconsistencies, 0 warnings, 0 errors)        
        
If you see that line, it means pg_catcheck didn't find any problems.        
Otherwise, pg_catcheck will generally print two lines of output for each        
problem it finds, like this:        
        
	notice: pg_class row has invalid relnamespace "24580": no matching entry in pg_namespace        
	row identity: oid="24581" relname="foo" relkind="r"        
	notice: pg_type row has invalid typnamespace "24580": no matching entry in pg_namespace        
	row identity: oid="24583"        
	notice: pg_type row has invalid typnamespace "24580": no matching entry in pg_namespace        
	row identity: oid="24582"        
	notice: pg_depend row has invalid refobjid "24580": no matching entry in pg_namespace        
	row identity: classid="1259" objid="24581" objsubid="0" refclassid="2615" refobjid="24580" refobjsubid="0" deptype="n"        
	progress: done (4 inconsistencies, 0 warnings, 0 errors)        
        
If the final output line mentions inconsistencies, that means that it found        
problems with the logical structure of your system catalogs.  Warnings or        
errors indicate more serious problems, like not being able to read the system        
catalogs at all.  In this particular example, there are four errors: one        
pg_class row, two pg_type rows, and one pg_depend row all reference an OID        
24580 which they expect to find in pg_namespace.  In reality, no such row        
exists.        
        
There are several ways to recover from an error of this type.  You could        
modify the OIDs in the referring rows so that they refer to a pg_namespace        
entry that does exist.  This might enable you to recover access to the        
underlying data.  Note that in this case all four references pertain to the        
same table (pg_class OID 24581, which has pg_type OIDs 24582 and 24583 for        
its record and array-of-record types) so you would probably want to make        
all of those references point to the same namespace.  Alternatively, if the        
dangling references are objects you don't care about (e.g. if the backing        
file for the pg_class entry doesn't even exist on disk), you could simply        
delete the referring rows also.  This is often enough to make pg_dump run        
successfully, which is often the main goal.        
        
Unless you are sure you understand what pg_catcheck is telling you, you        
may wish to consult with a PostgreSQL expert.  Changing the system catalogs        
manually can make a bad situation worse and lead to data loss, and should        
not be attempted unless you are knowledgeable about how PostgreSQL uses these        
catalogs.        
        
pg_catcheck also provides an option to run "SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 0"        
on each table in the database, which will detect missing or inaccessible        
relation files. The --select-from-relations option enables this check.
