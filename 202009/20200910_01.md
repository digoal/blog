## 背景    
原文    
https://pg.uptrace.dev/zfs/    
    
The main reason to use ZFS instead of ext4/xfs is compression. With reasonable configuration you can achieve 3-5x compression ratio using LZ4. That means that LZ4 compresses 1 terabyte of data down to ~300 gigabytes. With ZSTD compression is even better.    
    
The second reason is Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) cache. ARC is a page replacement algorithm with better performance than Linux page cache. Since it caches compressed blocks you can also fit more data into the same RAM.    
    
I recommend to start with the following configuration and tune it when you know more:    
    
- recordsize=128k - same as default.    
- compression=lz4 - enables lz4 compression.    
- atime=off - disables access time update.    
- xattr=sa - better extended attributes.    
- logbias=latency - same as default.    
- redundant_metadata=most - may improve random writes.    
If you are going to use ZFS snapshots, create separate dataset for PostgreSQL WAL files. This way snapshots of your main data will be smaller. Don't forget to backup WAL files separately so you can use (Point-in-Time Recovery)[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html].    
    
## ZFS recordsize    
The recordsize is the size of the largest block of data that ZFS will read/write. ZFS compresses each block individually and compression is better for larger blocks. Use the default recordsize=128k and decrease it to 32-64k if you need more TPS (transactions per second).    
    
- Larger recordsize means better compression. It also improves read/write performance if you operate with lots of data (tens of megabytes).    
- Smaller recordsize means more TPS.    
Setting recordsize=8k to match PostgreSQL block size reduces compression efficiency and is not recommended. While recordsize=8k improves the average transaction rate as reported by pgbench, good pgbench result is not an indicator of a good production performance. Measure performance of your queries before lowering recordsize.    
    
## Alignment Shift (ashift)    
For Amazon Elastic Block Store and other cloud stores use the default value. But if you know the underlying hardware you should configure ashift properly.    
    
## Disable PostgreSQL full page writes    
Because ZFS always writes full blocks you can disable full page writes in PostgreSQL via full_page_writes = off setting.    
    
## ARC and shared_buffers    
Since ARC caches compressed blocks it makes sense to use it over PostgreSQL shared_buffers for caching hot data. But making shared_buffers too small will negatively affect write speed. Thefore consider lowering shared_buffers as long as your write speed does not suffer too much and leave the rest of the RAM for ARC.    
    
## PostgreSQL block size and WAL size    
The default PostgreSQL block size is 8k and it does not match ZFS record size (by default 128k). The result is that while PostgreSQL writes data in 8k blocks ZFS have to operate with 128k records (known as write amplification). You can somewhat improve this situation by increasing PostgreSQL block size to 32k and WAL block size to 64k. This requires re-compiling PostgreSQL and re-initializing a database.    
    
- Larger blocksize considerably improves performance of the queries that read a lot of data (tens of megabytes). This effect is not specific to ZFS and you can use larger block sizes with other filesystems as well.    
- Smaller blocksize means more TPS.    
    
## Disabling TOAST compression    
You may want to disable PostgreSQL TOAST compression by setting column storage to EXTERNAL. But it does not make much difference:    
    
- LZ4 is fast.    
- Both LZ4 and ZSTD have special logic to skip incompressible (already compressed) parts of data.    
## logbias=latency    
Quote from reddit by @mercenary_sysadmin:    
    
Logbias=throughput with no SLOG will likely improve performance if your workload is lots of big block writes, which is a workload that usually isn't suffering from performance issues much in the first place.    
    
Logbias=throughput with no SLOG and small block writes will result in the most horrific fragmentation imaginable, which will penalize you both in the initial writes AND when you re read that data from metal later.
