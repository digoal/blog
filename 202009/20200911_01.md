使用pg_surgery插件, 通过擦除tuple内容或修改tuple的head信息，可以修复被逻辑损坏的tuple.  将tuple设置为dead或者all visible.  实际上也能和pg_dirty结合使用, 实现flashback

New contrib module, pg_surgery, with heap surgery functions.    
    
Sometimes it happens that the visibility information for a tuple    
becomes corrupted, either due to bugs in the database software or    
external factors. Provide a function heap_force_kill() that can    
be used to truncate such dead tuples to dead line pointers, and    
a function heap_force_freeze() that can be used to overwrite the    
visibility information in such a way that the tuple becomes    
all-visible.    
    
These functions are unsafe, in that you can easily use them to    
corrupt a database that was not previously corrupted, and you can    
use them to further corrupt an already-corrupted database or to    
destroy data. The documentation accordingly cautions against    
casual use. However, in some cases they permit recovery of data    
that would otherwise be very difficult to recover, or to allow a    
system to continue to function when it would otherwise be difficult    
to do so.    
    
Because we may want to add other functions for performing other    
kinds of surgery in the future, the new contrib module is called    
pg_surgery rather than something specific to these functions. I    
proposed back-patching this so that it could be more easily used    
by people running existing releases who are facing these kinds of    
problems, but that proposal did not attract enough support, so    
no back-patch for now.

```    
    
#### heap_force_kill(regclass, tid[]) returns void    
heap_force_kill marks “used” line pointers as “dead” without examining the tuples. The intended use of this function is to forcibly remove tuples that are not otherwise accessible. For example:    
    
```    
test=> select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';    
ERROR:  could not access status of transaction 4007513275    
DETAIL:  Could not open file "pg_xact/0EED": No such file or directory.    
    
test=# select heap_force_kill('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 1)']::tid[]);    
 heap_force_kill     
-----------------    
     
(1 row)    
    
test=# select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';    
(0 rows)    
```    
    
#### heap_force_freeze(regclass, tid[]) returns void    
heap_force_freeze marks tuples as frozen without examining the tuple data. The intended use of this function is to make accessible tuples which are inaccessible due to corrupted visibility information, or which prevent the table from being successfully vacuumed due to corrupted visibility information. For example:    
    
```    
test=> vacuum t1;    
ERROR:  found xmin 507 from before relfrozenxid 515    
CONTEXT:  while scanning block 0 of relation "public.t1"    
    
test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 507;    
 ctid      
-------    
 (0,3)    
(1 row)    
    
test=# select heap_force_freeze('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 3)']::tid[]);    
 heap_force_freeze     
-------------------    
     
(1 row)    
    
test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 2;    
 ctid    
-------    
 (0,3)    
(1 row)    
```
