# pgnodemx    
    
## Overview    
SQL functions that allow capture of node OS metrics from PostgreSQL    
    
## Security    
Executing role must have been granted pg_monitor membership (pgmonitor for PostgreSQL version 9.6 and below - see Compatibility section below).    
    
## cgroup Related Functions    
    
For detailed information about the various virtual files available on the cgroup file system, see:    
* cgroup v1: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html    
* cgroup v2: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html    
    
### General Access Functions    
    
cgroup virtual files fall into (at least) the following general categories, each with a generic SQL access function:    
    
* BIGINT single line scalar values - ```SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint(filename);```    
  * cgroup v1 examples: blkio.leaf_weight, blkio.weight, cpuacct.usage, cpuacct.usage_percpu, cpuacct.usage_percpu_sys, cpuacct.usage_percpu_user, cpuacct.usage_sys, cpuacct.usage_user, cpu.cfs_period_us, cpu.cfs_quota_us, cpu.rt_period_us, cpu.rt_runtime_us, cpu.shares, cpuacct.usage, memory.failcnt, memory.kmem.failcnt, memory.kmem.limit_in_bytes, memory.kmem.max_usage_in_bytes, memory.kmem.tcp.failcnt, memory.kmem.tcp.limit_in_bytes, memory.kmem.tcp.max_usage_in_bytes, memory.kmem.tcp.usage_in_bytes, memory.kmem.usage_in_bytes, memory.limit_in_bytes, memory.max_usage_in_bytes, memory.memsw.failcnt, memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes, memory.memsw.max_usage_in_bytes, memory.memsw.usage_in_bytes, memory.move_charge_at_immigrate, memory.soft_limit_in_bytes, memory.usage_in_bytes, net_cls.classid, net_prio.prioidx

  * cgroup v1 examples: (none known)    
  * cgroup v2 examples: memory.pressure, cpu.pressure, io.max, io.stat    
    
In each case, the filename must be in the form ```<controller>.<metric>```, e.g. ```memory.stat```.    
    
### Get status of cgroup support    
```    
SELECT current_setting('pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled');    
```    
* Returns boolean result ("on"/"off").    
* This value may be explicitly set in postgresql.conf    
* However the extension will disable it at runtime if the location pointed to by pgnodemx.cgrouproot does not exist or is not a valid cgroup v1 or v2 mount.    
    
### Get current cgroup mode    
```    
SELECT cgroup_mode();    
```    
* Returns the current cgroup mode. Possible values are "legacy", "unified", "hybrid", and "disabled". These correspond to cgroup v1, cgroup v2, mixed, and disabled, respectively.    
* Currently "hybrid" mode is not supported; it might be in the future.    
    
### Determine if Running Containerized    
```    
SELECT current_setting('pgnodemx.containerized');    
```    
* Returns boolean result ("on"/"off"). The extension attempts to heuristically determine whether PostgreSQL is running under a container, but this value may be explicitly set in postgresql.conf to override the heuristically determined value. The value of this setting influences the cgroup paths which are used to read the cgroup controller files.    
    
### Get cgroup Paths    
```    
SELECT controller, path FROM cgroup_path();    
```    
* Returns the path to each supported cgroup controller.    
    
### Get cgroup process count    
```    
SELECT cgroup_process_count();    
```    
* Returns the number of processes assigned to the cgroup    
* For cgroup v1, based on the "memory" controller cgroup.procs file. For cgroup v2, based on the unified cgroup.procs file.    
    
## Environment Variable Related Functions    
    
### Get Environment Variable as TEXT    
```    
SELECT envvar_text('PGDATA');    
```    
* Returns the value of requested environment variable as TEXT    
    
### Get Environment Variable as BIGINT    
```    
SELECT envvar_bigint('PGPORT');    
```    
* Returns the value of requested environment variable as BIGINT    
    
## ```/proc``` Related Functions    
    
For more detailed information about the /proc file system virtual files, please see: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html    
    
### Get "/proc/diskstats" as a virtual table    
```    
SELECT * FROM proc_diskstats();    
```    
    
### Get "/proc/self/mountinfo" as a virtual table    
```    
SELECT * FROM proc_mountinfo();    
```    
    
### Get "/proc/meminfo" as a virtual table    
```    
SELECT * FROM proc_meminfo();    
```    
    
### Get "/proc/self/net/dev" as a virtual table    
```    
SELECT * FROM proc_network_stats();    
```    
    
## System Information Related Functions    
    
### Get file system information as a virtual table    
```    
SELECT * FROM fsinfo(path text);    
```    
* Returns major_number, minor_number, type, block_size, blocks, total_bytes, free_blocks, free_bytes, available_blocks, available_bytes, total_file_nodes, free_file_nodes, and mount_flags for the file system on which ```path``` is mounted.    
    
## Kubernetes DownwardAPI Related Functions    
    
For more detailed information about the Kubernetes DownwardAPI please see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/    
    
### Get status of kdapi_enabled    
```    
SELECT current_setting('pgnodemx.kdapi_enabled');    
```    
* Returns boolean result ("on"/"off").    
* This value may be explicitly set in postgresql.conf    
* However the extension will disable it at runtime if the location pointed to by pgnodemx.kdapi_path does not exist.    
    
### Access "key equals quoted value" files    
```    
SELECT * FROM kdapi_setof_kv('filename');    
```    
    
### Get scalar BIGINT from file    
```    
SELECT kdapi_scalar_bigint('filename text');    
```    
    
## Configuration    
    
* Add pgnodemx to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf.    
```    
shared_preload_libraries = 'pgnodemx'    
```    
* The following custom parameters may be set. The values shown are defaults. If the default values work for you, there is no need to add these to ```postgresql.conf```.    
```    
# enable or disable the cgroup facility    
pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled = on    
# force use of "containerized" assumptions for cgroup file paths    
pgnodemx.containerized = off    
# specify location of cgroup mount    
pgnodemx.cgrouproot = '/sys/fs/cgroup'    
# enable cgroup functions    
pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled = on    
# enable or disable the Kubernetes DownwardAPI facility    
pgnodemx.kdapi_enabled = on    
# specify location of Kubernetes DownwardAPI files    
pgnodemx.kdapi_path = '/etc/podinfo'    
```    
Notes:    
* If pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled is defined in ```postgresql.conf```, and set to ```off``` (or ```false```), then all cgroup* functions will return NULL, or zero rows, except cgroup_mode() which will return "disabled".    
* If ```pgnodemx.containerized``` is defined in ```postgresql.conf```, that value will override pgnodemx heuristics. When not specified, pgnodemx heuristics will determine if the value should be ```on``` or ```off``` at runtime.    
* If the location specified by ```pgnodemx.cgrouproot```, default or as set in ```postgresql.conf```, is not accessible (does not exist, or otherwise causes an error when accessed), then pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled is forced to ```off``` at runtime and all cgroup* functions will return NULL, or zero rows, except cgroup_mode() which will return "disabled".    
* If the location specified by ```pgnodemx.kdapi_path```, default or as set in ```postgresql.conf```, is not accessible (does not exist, or otherwise causes an error when accessed), then pgnodemx.kdapi_enabled is forced to ```off``` at runtime and all kdapi* functions will return NULL, or zero rows.    
    
## Installation    
    
### Compatibility    
    
* PostgreSQL version 9.5 or newer is required.    
* On PostgreSQL version 9.6 or earlier, a role called pgmonitor must be created, and the user calling these functions must be granted that role.    
    
### Compile and Install    
    
Clone PostgreSQL repository:    
    
```bash    
$> git clone https://github.com/postgres/postgres.git    
```    
    
Checkout REL_12_STABLE (for example) branch:    
    
```bash    
$> git checkout REL_12_STABLE    
```    
    
Make PostgreSQL:    
    
```bash    
$> ./configure    
$> make install -s    
```    
    
Change to the contrib directory:    
    
```bash    
$> cd contrib    
```    
    
Clone ```pgnodemx``` extension:    
    
```bash    
$> git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/pgnodemx    
```    
    
Change to ```pgnodemx``` directory:    
    
```bash    
$> cd pgnodemx    
```    
    
Build ```pgnodemx```:    
    
```bash    
$> make    
```    
    
Install ```pgnodemx```:    
    
```bash    
$> make install    
```    
    
#### Using PGXS    
    
If an instance of PostgreSQL is already installed, then PGXS can be utilized to build and install ```pgnodemx```.  Ensure that PostgreSQL binaries are available via the ```$PATH``` environment variable then use the following commands.    
    
```bash    
$> make USE_PGXS=1    
$> make USE_PGXS=1 install    
```    
    
### Configure    
    
The following bash commands should configure your system to utilize pgnodemx. Replace all paths as appropriate. It may be prudent to visually inspect the files afterward to ensure the changes took place.    
    
###### Initialize PostgreSQL (if needed):    
    
```bash    
$> initdb -D /path/to/data/directory    
```    
    
###### Create Target Database (if needed):    
    
```bash    
$> createdb <database>    
```    
    
###### Install ```pgnodemx``` functions:    
    
Edit postgresql.conf and add ```pgnodemx``` to the shared_preload_libraries line, and change custom settings as mentioned above.    
    
Finally, restart PostgreSQL (method may vary):    
    
```    
$> service postgresql restart    
```    
Install the extension into your database:    
    
```bash    
psql <database>    
CREATE EXTENSION pgnodemx;    
```    
    
## TODO    
    
* Map more ```/proc``` files to virtual tables    
* Add support for "hybrid" cgroup mode    
    
## 例子    
pgnodemx    
    
As mentioned above, pgnodemx is a PostgreSQL extension. It adds a variety of new functions to PostgreSQL which will be used to grab the desired data from our PostgreSQL cluster via standard SQL statements.    
    
Installation and configuration    
First things first: in order to install and configure pgnodemx in your own PostgreSQL instance, follow the instructions in the README. However, since the main focus of this blog is the containerized solution, the most likely way to deploy is using Crunchy Operator. The new version 4.5 of Operator and Containers will be released "Real Soon Now", and they will install and configure the extension and pgMonitor for you.    
    
Provided Functionality    
The functions provided by pgnodemx currently fall into the following categories:    
```    
cgroup    
environment    
/proc    
Kubernetes Downward API    
general    
```    
    
Now we will cover those categories one at a time.    
    
cgroup Related Functions    
These functions broadly fall into two subcategories. The first type are functions that read and parse the various cgroup file system virtual files and return the results in a naturally mapped form. The README calls these "General Access Functions". The second type of function returns information about the detected cgroup context.    
    
Some examples of cgroup Related Functions:    
    
```

userdb=# SELECT current_setting('pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled');    
 current_setting     
-----------------    
 on    
(1 row)    
```    
    
From the output you can see that the PostgreSQL cluster is running on a host which is in legacy mode. This implies that PostgreSQL is running under cgroup v1, which until very recently was always the case when running containerized under Kubernetes. The alternatives are unified and hybrid. The former is what you will get if running on a cgroup v2 host, e.g. with a modern Linux kernel under systemd and with appropriate configuration. The mode hybrid indicates that the host is configured for both cgroup v1 and v2 -- this mode is (at least currently) explicitly not supported by pgnodemx.    
    
Although this blog is primarily focused on legacy Kubernetes installations, please allow a small sidebar discussion. If you did want to explore the use of pgnodemx on a host in unified mode under systemd, you probably need to add the following to your Linux kernel command line: systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 cgroup_no_v1=all. Additionally you will want to override the installed PostgreSQL systemd service file, and add accounting (and possibly resource limits) for the controllers of interest, for example:    
    
```    
CPUAccounting=yes    
MemoryAccounting=yes    
TasksAccounting=yes    
IOAccounting=yes    
IPAccounting=yes    
```    
    
Anyway, returning to the code snippet above, you can see that cgroup_path() is a set-returning function which returns the resolved paths to all of the cgroup controllers. The process count for the cgroup, which in Kubernetes-land corresponds to the Pod in which PostgreSQL is running, is given by the scalar function unsurprisingly named cgroup_process_count().    
    
Finally, the built-in PostgreSQL function current_setting() is used to inquire about the values of two key configuration parameters controlling behavior of the extension. These parameters have generally sensible defaults, and the extension attemps to override them as required by the host context at PostgreSQL startup (pgnodemx must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries), but if you need you can set these values in postgresql.conf yourself. Note that pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled = off can be used, and indeed is set by pgnodemx when required, in order to disable cgroup support entirely.    
    
Now let's look at some of the "General Access Functions". This set of examples shows how it is possible to read the current memory usage, the given memory limit, and the relevant CPU limits for the cgroup (Kubernetes Pod):    
    
```    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
            241020928    
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_float8('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_float8     
----------------------    
            240971776    
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_text('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_text     
--------------------    
 240971776    
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.limit_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
            536870912    
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('cpu.cfs_period_us');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
               100000    
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('cpu.cfs_quota_us');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
                10000    
(1 row)    
```    
    
In the snippet above, general access functions are shown that are designed to read cgroup virtual files that return a single row of a single scalar value. There are BIGINT, TEXT, and FLOAT8 variants of the scalar access type function. These functions will do their best to coerce the characters read from the virtual file into the matching data type. If the characters cannot be coerced, and ERROR will be returned.    
    
Next let's see some expected failure cases:    
    
```    
userdb=# -- should return NULL    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint(null);    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
                         
(1 row)    
    
userdb=# -- should fail    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('bar/../../etc/memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  reference to parent directory ("..") not allowed    
userdb=# -- should fail    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('/memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  reference to absolute path not allowed    
userdb=# CREATE USER pgnodemx_joe;    
CREATE ROLE    
userdb=# SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION pgnodemx_joe;    
SET    
userdb=> -- should fail    
userdb=> SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  must be member of pg_monitor role    
userdb=> RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION;    
RESET    
userdb=# DROP USER pgnodemx_joe;    
DROP ROLE    
```    
    
Here we see that bad arguments will result in either NULL (for NULL input) or an ERROR. Generally speaking the cgroup general access functions all take a virtual file name as an argument. The filename must not be NULL, and must not be absolute or parent referencing relative paths. Also, the invoking user must be a member of the built-in pg_monitor role (or an administrator created pgmonitor for PostgreSQL version 9.6 or earlier).    
    
There are several other types of general access functions. Rather than try to show them all here, please see the README and try out the extension for yourself. However at the risk of providing too much detail, one more example might be interesting:    
    
```    
userdb=# SELECT * FROM cgroup_setof_kv('cpu.stat');    
      key       |      val          
----------------+---------------

In this example there are two types of access functions: cgroup_setof_kv() and cgroup_setof_ksv(). These are appropriate when the cgroup virtual file contains multiple rows in key-value pairs or key-subkey-value triplets respectively. The snippet shows how it is possible to obtain fairly detailed information regarding CPU, memory, and I/O usage of the cgroup/Pod. Neat stuff if I do say so myself!    
    
Kubernetes Downward API Related Functions    
Let's skip over the other function types for the moment and touch on the Kubernetes Downward API related functions, because they are similar in some ways to the cgroup related functions. This API exposes Pod and Container information through both environment variables as well as "Volume Files". We'll discuss a set of generic functions for reading environment variables in the next section. In pgnodemx the Kubernetes Downward API support functions are specifically targeted at the "Volume Files". See the documentation linked above for details with respect to how to create those files and what information may be exposed. At least one interesting bit of info that is difficult to obtain otherwise is the Kubernetes "request" values for things like CPU and memory. Since these are not mapped directly to cgroup virtual files anyway (at least as far as I have been able to determine), this seems to be the only way to get that information via introspection from PostgreSQL.

Similar to the cgroup facility, pgnodemx.kdapi_enabled = off can be used, and indeed is set by pgnodemx when required, in order to disable Kubernetes Downward API support entirely.    
    
In the above code the use of set-returning function kdapi_setof_kv() and scalar function kdapi_scalar_bigint() are illustrated. The memory and CPU request values are easily obtained via this facility. There is also an example of reconstituting the status annotation from Kubernetes as a PostgreSQL jsonb value.    
    
Environment, /proc, and "Other" Functions    
As alluded to above, there are two provided functions for reading scalar environment variables and coercing them to an appropriate PostgreSQL data type: pgnodemx_envvar_text() and pgnodemx_envvar_bigint(). Their use is pretty straightforward and can be seen in the README.    
    
There are also several functions that read and parse specific /proc virtual files and return the information contained in a suitably mapped form. Their use is also shown in the documentation, so to keep this blog from becoming too obnoxiously long we'll ask you to "read the fine manual". However I would like to leave you with one more interesting query that combines two of the /proc functions with a general system information function, fsinfo(). This last function does not read from any virtual file but instead gets information directly from kernel syscalls. On second thought we will also look at one of the /proc functions. Without further ado:    
    
```    
userdb=# SELECT interface,    
                rx_bytes, rx_packets,    
                tx_bytes, tx_packets    
         FROM proc_network_stats();

The first query here gives us network I/O on the available interfaces, while the second gives fairly comprehensive information about the file system on which our PostgreSQL data directory is mounted.
