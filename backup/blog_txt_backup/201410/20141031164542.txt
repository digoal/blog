EnterpriseDB pg_hibernator like combined pg_prewarm & pg_buffercache

2014-10-31 16:45:42   查看原文>>

类似pg_prewarm和pg_buffercache的结合产品, pg_prewarm用于将指定的对象对应的数据块加载到shared buffer,
pg_buffercache记录当前sharedbuffer的使用情况, 包括filenode, blockid等信息.
pg_hibernator则是结合了两者的一个独立extension, 可以在关闭数据库时将block id的信息保存到文件, 在启动时读这个文件并将block加载到shared buffer.
与pgfincore不同的是, pg_hibernator是将block加载到shared buffer, 而不是os cache.

Postgres Hibernator

This Postgres extension is a set-it-and-forget-it solution to save and restore the Postgres shared-buffers contents, across Postgres server restarts.

It performs the automatic save and restore of database buffers, integrated with database shutdown and startup, hence reducing the durations of database maintenance windows, in effect increasing the uptime of your applications.

Postgres Hibernator automatically saves the list of shared buffers to the disk on database shutdown, and automatically restores the buffers on database startup. This acts pretty much like your Operating System's hibernate feature, except, instead of saving the contents of the memory to disk, Postgres Hibernator saves
just a list of block identifiers. And it uses that list after startup to restore the blocks from data directory into Postgres' shared buffers.

 Unique Feature

To my knowledge, no other RDBMS/DBMS, commercial or open-source, provides this capability of saving and restoring database cache across server restarts.

 Why

DBAs are often faced with the task of performing some maintenance on their database server(s) which requires shutting down the database. The maintenance may involve anything from a database patch application, to a hardware upgrade. One ugly side-effect of restarting the database server/service is that all the data
currently in database server's memory will be all lost, which was painstakingly fetched from disk and put there in response to application queries over time. And this data will have to be rebuilt as applications start querying database again. The query response times will be very high until all the “hot” data is
fetched from disk and put back in memory again.

People employ a few tricks to get around this ugly truth, which range from running a select * from app_table;, to dd if=table_file ..., to using specialized utilities like pgfincore to prefetch data files into OS cache. Wouldn't it be ideal if the database itself could save and restore its memory contents across
restarts!

The duration for which the server is building up caches, and trying to reach its optimal cache performance is called ramp-up time. Postgres Hibernator is aimed at reducing the ramp-up time of Postgres servers.

 How

Get the source code of this extension.

$ wget -O pg_hibernator.zip https://github.com/gurjeet/pg_hibernator/archive/master.zip
$ unzip -j -d pg_hibernator pg_hibernator.zip

or

$ git clone https://github.com/gurjeet/pg_hibernator.git

Compile and install the extension (you'll need a Postgres instalation and its pg_config in $PATH):

$ cd pg_hibernator
$ make install

Then.

 1. Add pg_hibernator to the shared_preload_libraries variable in postgresql.conf file.
 2. Restart the Postgres server.
 3. You are done.

 How it works

This extension uses the Background Worker infrastructure of Postgres, which was introduced in Postgres 9.3. When the server starts, this extension registers background workers; one for saving the buffers (calledBuffer Saver) when the server shuts down, and one for each database in the cluster (called Block Readers)
for restoring the buffers saved during previous shutdown.

When the Postgres server is being stopped/shut down, the Buffer Saver scans the shared-buffers of Postgres, and stores the unique block identifiers of each cached block to the disk. This information is saved under the $PGDATA/pg_hibernator/ directory. For each of the database whose blocks are resident in shared
buffers, one file is created; for eg.: $PGDATA/pg_hibernator/2.save.

During the next startup sequence, the Block Reader threads are registerd, one for each file present under $PGDATA/pg_hibernator/ directory. When the Postgres server has reached stable state (that is, it's ready for database connections), these Block Reader processes are launched. The Block Readerprocess reads the
save-files looking for block-ids to restore. It then connects to the respective database, and requests Postgres to fetch the blocks into shared-buffers.

 Configuration

This extension can be controlled via the following parameters. These parameters can be set in postgresql.conf or on postmaster's command-line.

  • pg_hibernator.enabled

    Setting this parameter to false disables the hibernator features. That is, on server startup the BlockReader processes will not be launched, and on server shutdown the list of blicks in shared buffers will not be saved.

    Note that the BuffersSaver process exists at all times, even when this parameter is set to false. This is to allow the DBA to enable/disable the extension without having to restart the server. The BufferSaver process checks this parameter during server startup and right before shutdown, and honors this parameter's
    value at that time.

    To enable/disable Postgres Hibernator at runtime, change the value in postgresql.conf and usepg_ctl reload to make Postgres re-read the new parameter values from postgresql.conf.

    Default value: true.

  • pg_hibernator.parallel

    This parameter controls whether Postgres Hibernator launches the BlockReader processes in parallel, or sequentially, waiting for current BlockReader to exit before launching the next one.

    When enabled, all the BlockReaders, one for each database, will be launched simultaneously, and this may cause huge random-read flood on disks if there are many databases in cluster. This may also cause some BlockReaders to fail to launch successfully because of max_worker_processeslimit.

    Default value: false.

  • pg_hibernator.default_database

    The BufferSaver process needs to connect to a database in order to perform the database-name lookups etc. This parameter controls which database the BufferSaver process connects to for perfoming these operations.

    Default value: postgres.

 Caveats

  • Buffer list is saved only when Postgres is shutdown in "smart" and "fast" modes.

    That is, buffer list is not saved when database crashes, or on "immediate" shutdown.

  • A reduction in shared_buffers is not detected.

    If the shared_buffers is reduced across a restart, and if the combined saved buffer list is larger than the new shared_buffers lize, Postgres Hibernator continues to read and restore blocks even aftershared_buffers worth of buffers have been restored.

 Nice-to-have features

  • Save/restore the filesystem buffers or disk cache

    It's very desirable to save/restore filesystem buffers, that back the data directory, across database server restart. This will restore those data blocks to memory that were read/modified by Postgres, but then evicted from shared buffers, and yet are available in filesystem/disk cache.

    I looked at pgfincore, but decided against including that feature-set in Postgres Hibernator because, (a) pgfincore requires the user to know beforehand which tables/indexes they will need in future, and (b) Postgres Hibernator is supposed to be as invisible to the user/DBA as much as possible.

    One possible solution is to hook into Postgres' buffer-eviction code (at the end of BufferAlloc()), and keep track of which buffers are being evicted. The downsides of this approach are that (a) it adds a huge overhead to an otherwise free operation, and (b) the user now needs to be aware of the size of filesystem
    cache, and what portion of it may be dedicated to Postgres' data files; hence losing the invisibility that Postgres Hibernator seeks.

  • Save/restore a snapshot of buffers

    It may be desirable to have the feature where one can save a snapshot of shared buffers, and restore it at a later point.

    I envision it to be useful in cases where a standby has just been created, and DBA wants this new standby to have the same buffers contents as the master, so that the standby can start serving queries at full speed, as soon as possible.

 FAQ

  • What is the relationship between pg_buffercache, pg_prewarm, and pg_hibernator?

    They all allow you to do different things with Postgres' shared buffers.

      □ pg_buffercahce:

        Inspect and show contents of shared buffers

      □ pg_prewarm:

        Load some table/index/fork blocks into shared buffers. User needs to tell it which blocks to load.

      □ pg_hibernator:

        Upon shutdown, save list of blocks stored in shared buffers. Upon startup, loads those blocks back into shared buffers.

    The goal of Postgres Hibernator is to be invisible to the user/DBA. Whereas with pg_prewarm the user needs to know a lot of stuff about what they really want to do, most likely information gathered viapg_buffercahce.

  • Does pg_hibernate use either pg_buffercache or pg_prewarm?

    No, Postgres Hibernator works all on its own.

    If the concern is, "Do I have to install pg_buffercache and pg_prewarm to use pg_hibernator", the answer is no. pg_hibernator is a stand-alone extension, although influenced by pg_buffercache and pg_prewarm.

    With pg_prewarm you can load blocks of only the database you're connected to. So if you have Ndatabases in your cluster, to restore blocks of all databases, the DBA will have to connect to each database and invoke pg_prewarm functions.

    With pg_hibernator, DBA isn't required to do anything, let alone connecting to the database!

  • Is this an EDB product?

    It's an open-source project, developed by Gurjeet Singh, an EDB employee, and contributed to community. It works with both Postgres and EDB.

  • What versions of Postgres/EDB are supported.

    Postgres Hibernator supports Postgres and EDB's Postgres Plus Advanced Server products, and versions 9.3 and 9.4 of both products.

  • Where can I learn more about it?

    There are a couple of blog posts and initial proposal to Postgres hackers' mailing list. They may provide a better understanding of Postgres Hibernator.
