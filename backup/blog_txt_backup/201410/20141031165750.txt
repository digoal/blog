MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL

This MongoDB extension implements the PostgreSQL's Foreign Data Wrapper.

Please note that this version of mongo_fdw only works with PostgreSQL Version 9.3 and greater.

 Installation

The MongoDB FDW depends on the official MongoDB C Driver version 0.8 and includes it as a git submodule. If you are cloning this repository for the first time, be sure to pass the --recursive option to git clone in order to initialize the driver submodule to a useable state.

If have checked out this project before and for some reason your submodule is not up-to-date, run git submodule update --init.

When you type make, the C driver's source code also gets automatically compiled and linked.

Note: Make sure you have permission to "/usr/local" (default installation location) folder.

Note that we have verified the mongo_fdw extension only on MacOS X, Fedora and Ubuntu systems. If you run into issues on other systems, please let us know

 Enhancements

The following enhancements are added to the latest version of mongo_fdw

 Write-able FDW

The previous version was only read-only, the latest version provides the write capability. The user can now issue insert/update and delete statements for the foreign tables using the mongo_fdw.

 Connection Pooling

The latest version comes with a connection pooler that utilises the same mongo database connection for all the queries in the same session. The previous version would open a new mongodb connection for every query. This is a performance enhancement.

 New MongoDB C Driver Support

The third enhancement is to add a new MongoDB' C driver. The current implementation is based on the legacy driver of MongoDB. But MongoDB is provided completely new library for driver called MongoDB's Meta Driver. So I have added support of that driver. Now compile time option is available to use legacy and Meta
driver. I am sure there are many other benefits of the new Mongo-C-driver that we are not leveraging but we will adopt those as we learn more about the new C driver.

 Usage

The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign server object:

  • address: the address or hostname of the MongoDB server Defaults to 127.0.0.1
  • port: the port number of the MongoDB server. Defaults to 27017

The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign table object:

  • database: the name of the MongoDB database to query. Defaults to test
  • collection: the name of the MongoDB collection to query. Defaults to the foreign table name used in the relevant CREATE command

As an example, the following commands demonstrate loading the mongo_fdw wrapper, creating a server, and then creating a foreign table associated with a MongoDB collection. The commands also show specifying option values in the OPTIONS clause. If an option value isn't provided, the wrapper uses the default value
mentioned above.

mongo_fdw can collect data distribution statistics will incorporate them when estimating costs for the query execution plan. To see selected execution plans for a query, just run EXPLAIN.

Examples with MongoDB's equivalent statments.

-- load extension first time after install
CREATE EXTENSION mongo_fdw;

-- create server object
CREATE SERVER mongo_server
         FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mongo_fdw
         OPTIONS (address '127.0.0.1', port '27017');

-- create user mapping
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR postgres
         SERVER mongo_server
         OPTIONS (username 'mongo_user', password 'mongo_pass');

-- create foreign table
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE warehouse(
         _id NAME,
         warehouse_id int,
         warehouse_name text,
         warehouse_created timestamptz)
SERVER mongo_server
         OPTIONS (database 'db', collection 'warehouse');

-- Note: first column of the table must be "_id" of type "NAME".

-- select from table
SELECT * FROM warehouse WHERE warehouse_id = 1;

           _id          | warehouse_id | warehouse_name |     warehouse_created
------------------------+----------------+---------------------------
53720b1904864dc1f5a571a0|            1 | UPS            | 12-DEC-14 12:12:10 +05:00


db.warehouse.find({"warehouse_id" : 1}).pretty()
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("53720b1904864dc1f5a571a0"),
    "warehouse_id" : 1,
    "warehouse_name" : "UPS",
    "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z")
}


-- insert row in table
INSERT INTO warehouse values (0, 1, 'UPS', to_date('2014-12-12T07:12:10Z'));

db.warehouse.insert
(
    {
        "warehouse_id" : NumberInt(1),
        "warehouse_name" : "UPS",
        "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z")
    }
);

-- delete row from table
DELETE FROM warehouse where warehouse_id = 3;

>    db.warehouse.remove({"warehouse_id" : 2})


-- update a row of table
UPDATE warehouse set warehouse_name = 'UPS_NEW' where warehouse_id = 1;

db.warehouse.update
(
   {
        "warehouse_id" : 1
   },
   {
        "warehouse_id" : 1,
        "warehouse_name" : "UPS_NEW"
   }
)

-- explain a table
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM warehouse WHERE warehouse_id = 1;
                           QUERY PLAN
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Foreign Scan on warehouse  (cost=0.00..0.00 rows=1000 width=44)
   Filter: (warehouse_id = 1)
   Foreign Namespace: db.warehouse
 Planning time: 0.671 ms
(4 rows)

-- collect data distribution statistics`
ANALYZE warehouse;

 Limitations

  • If the BSON document key contains uppercase letters or occurs within a nested document,mongo_fdw requires the corresponding column names to be declared in double quotes.

  • Note that PostgreSQL limits column names to 63 characters by default. If you need column names that are longer, you can increase the NAMEDATALEN constant in src/include/pg_config_manual.h, compile, and reinstall.

 Contributing

Have a fix for a bug or an idea for a great new feature? Great! Check out the contribution guidelines here. For all other types of questions or comments about the wrapper please contact us at mongo_fdw @enterprisedb.com.

 Support

This project will be modified to maintain compatibility with new PostgreSQL releases. The project owners set aside a day every month to look over open issues and support emails, but are not engaged in active feature development. Reported bugs will be addressed by apparent severity.

As with many open source projects, you may be able to obtain support via the public mailing list (mongo_fdw @ enterprisedb.com). If you need commercial support, please contact the EnterpriseDB sales team, or check whether your existing PostgreSQL support provider can also support mongo_fdw.
