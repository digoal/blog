Then I checked too in  our last SAN configuration with SanHealth the section "fabric summary"  and there those ports looked like this for both ports:<br> speed 1Gbps, status online, type false, Avg Perf 0MB/s, Max Perf 0MB/s, other fields were empty.<br><br>Then  I ran the command portdisable just for port 40 and then I enabled it  but after portenable the port kept in state in_sync, i disabled it again  and i went to the data center and i unplugged the port 40 and plugged  it again but in a diferent port but I didn?t get any answer, there the  port kept in_sync too, and it was the same with port 40. <br><br> 15 15 id N4 In_Sync <br> 40 40 id N4 In_Sync <br><br>Now  we are waiting for a test of the fibre cable and for the tape unit, but  in the midtime I really want to understand what could cause this  situation or why without any change in port type configuration in the  switch those ports got in this state and when i disabled them they  change from online to in_sync state. What is the meanin for  loopback-&gt;port and what situations can cause the change for the  porttype<br><br>回复:<br></span>Hi Andre<span><br>Here’s some info that may help....<br> Loopback...<br>You can put a port into loopback mode for testing and diagnostics, this is usually done with a loopback cable connected.<br>However some commands just test the internals of the ASIC in loopback, commands such as crossporttest.<br>But a port must be manually placed into loopback mode by someone???<br><br>In_Sync Port status....<br>Definitely check the device and the optics that does sound like the most likely cause.<br></span>If  you disable/enable plug out/in a port C the device on that port goes  through a whole handshake process and a Fabric login (FLOGI) and Port  Login (PLOGI).&nbsp; Then end result is that the port gets an on-line status  and the device gets registered in the name server.&nbsp; In the “old” days  device drivers sometimes mishandled the FLOGI/PLOGI timing and we used  to see the occasional issue with ports coming online.&nbsp; But I haven’t  seen this in at least 6 years.&nbsp; The switch tracks this login/port change  stuff in the portlogdump and your support provider should be able to  decode the portlogdump to see exactly what is going on when that device  is plugged in.&nbsp; That said, if it’s an optics problem, then you will get  nothing in the portlogdump as the switch is not seeing anything.<br><br>不知道是不是EVA6400控制器坏掉之后会导致光纤模块自动回环呢？</div>
