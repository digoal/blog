ARPING(8)              System Manager’s Manual: iputils              ARPING(8)

NAME
       arping - send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host

SYNOPSIS
       arping [ -AbDfhqUV]  [ -c count]  [ -w deadline]  [ -s source]  -I interface destination

DESCRIPTION
       Ping destination on device interface by ARP packets, using source address source.

OPTIONS
       -A     The same as -U, but ARP REPLY packets used instead of ARP REQUEST.

       -b     Send  only  MAC  level  broadcasts. Normally arping starts from sending broadcast, and switch to unicast
              after reply received.

       -c count
              Stop after sending count ARP REQUEST packets. With deadline option, arping waits  for  count  ARP  REPLY
              packets, until the timeout expires.

       -D     Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). See RFC2131, 4.4.1.  Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies
              are received

       -f     Finish after the first reply confirming that target is alive.

       -I interface
              Name of network device where to send ARP REQUEST packets. This option is required.

       -h     Print help page and exit.

       -q     Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.

       -s source
              IP source address to use in ARP packets.  If this option is absent, source address is:

              · In DAD mode (with option -D) set to 0.0.0.0.

              · In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options -U or -A) set to destination.


              · Otherwise, it is calculated from routing tables.

       -U     Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours’ ARP caches.  No replies are expected.

       -V     Print version of the program and exit.

       -w deadline
              Specify a timeout, in seconds, before arping exits regardless of how many  packets  have  been  sent  or
              received.  In  this  case arping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline
              expire or until count probes are answered.

AUTHOR
       arping was written by Alexey Kuznetsov <kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>.

SECURITY
       arping requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be executed. It is not recommended to  be  used  as  set-uid  root,
       because it allows user to modify ARP caches of neighbour hosts.

AVAILABILITY
       arping  is  part  of  iputils  package  and the latest versions are  available in source form for anonymous ftp
       ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz.
