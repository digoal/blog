Avoid pin scan for replay of XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM in all cases

Replay of XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM during Hot Standby was previously thought to
require complex interlocking that matched the requirements on the
master. This required an O(N) operation that became a significant
problem with large indexes, causing replication delays of seconds or in
some cases minutes while the XLOG_BTREE_VACUUM was replayed.

This commit skips the “pin scan” that was previously required, by
observing in detail when and how it is safe to do so, with full
documentation. The pin scan is skipped only in replay; the VACUUM code
path on master is not touched here.

No tests included. Manual tests using an additional patch to view WAL records
and their timing have shown the change in WAL records and their handling has
successfully reduced replication delay.

This is a back-patch of commits 687f2cd7a015, 3e4b7d87988f, b60284261375
by Simon Riggs, to branches 9.4 and 9.5.  No further backpatch is
possible because this depends on catalog scans being MVCC.  I (Álvaro)
additionally updated a slight problem in the README, which explains why
this touches the 9.6 and master branches.

 
 523 The interlocking required to avoid returning incorrect results from
 524 non-MVCC scans is not required on standby nodes. That is because
 525 HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate(), HeapTupleSatisfiesSelf(),
 526 HeapTupleSatisfiesDirty() and HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum() are only
 527 ever used during write transactions, which cannot exist on the standby.
 528 MVCC scans are already protected by definition, so HeapTupleSatisfiesMVCC()
 529 is not a problem.  That leaves concern only for HeapTupleSatisfiesToast().
 530 HeapTupleSatisfiesToast() doesn't use MVCC semantics, though that's
 531 because it doesn't need to - if the main heap row is visible then the
 532 toast rows will also be visible. So as long as we follow a toast
 533 pointer from a visible (live) tuple the corresponding toast rows
 534 will also be visible, so we do not need to recheck MVCC on them.
 535 There is one minor exception, which is that the optimizer sometimes
 536 looks at the boundaries of value ranges using SnapshotDirty, which
 537 could result in returning a newer value for query statistics; this
 538 would affect the query plan in rare cases, but not the correctness.
 539 The risk window is small since the stats look at the min and max values
 540 in the index, so the scan retrieves a tid then immediately uses it
 541 to look in the heap. It is unlikely that the tid could have been
 542 deleted, vacuumed and re-inserted in the time taken to look in the heap
 543 via direct tid access. So we ignore that scan type as a problem.
